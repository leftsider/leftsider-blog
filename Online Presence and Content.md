# P
1. Currently, there's no intentional representation of me online
2. My desire to leave something to be remembered by is not fulfilled
3. In the past, my online presence was a representation of what I was curious about, working on, and wanted to be engaged with. This is no longer the case; leftsider.com goes nowhere, and the domain itself may be on email blacklists due to spam issues. 

# B
At this moment in history where,
- technology is rapidly developing, with lots of opportunity for the possible
- I'm mid-career and plateaued, and would benefit from a bit more exploration 
- I've all but lost a current sense of community, and am not near to those with whom I've shared community in the past
Resurrecting Leftsider opens the way for
- a new phase of developing my identity
- a return to an online repository of my exploration, trying, building, seeing what's possible
- developing intentional community
Which will hopefully be
- a positive reflection of my lived existence
- a worthwhile promotion of me professionally
- personally stimulating, engaging and enriching

| what | why | how |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| online landing page | so that when someone searches "leftsider" or "Bryan Collick" we have an intentionally designed option to be included in the search results |  |
| discord community | so that I can engage with people I like on things that excite and challenge me in the right ways |  |
| curriculum vitae | so that when someone searches me professionally, they can see what I've been up to in my career.  |  |
| writings | a way to organize the things in my head and get them out of my brain |  |
| vlog | to give a record of who I am to the future |  |

- I don't follow through because I didn't plan well
- I don't follow through because it isn't rewarding
- I don't follow through because I've taken on too much
- I don't follow through because what I've created is overly complex/involved
- The endeavor does not give positive representation of who I am
- The endeavor does not generate engagement and/or community

# S
- I am satisfactorily represented online
- I find the effort rewarding
- I am able to build community around my efforts

**what?**
so two ideas:
- resurrect leftsider blog
	- Why? Because with a little effort you can monetize and maybe get enough coin to cover the cost (is there even server cost these days?)
		- *this would certainly be selling my soul*
- reinvent leftsider as a youtube channel
	- Why? Because I have this dream of leaving something that will represent me long after I'm gone... and nobody reads blogs anymore

### youtube
- a message to the future
	- unknown record of a life in this life and times
		- anonymity
			- ai character or ai generated graphics
			- ai manipulated voice
- the future is now; tomorrow never comes. The moment this is created it is past.


### blog
- no more self hosting?
	- github flat file site?
- supplemental to the youtube channel?
