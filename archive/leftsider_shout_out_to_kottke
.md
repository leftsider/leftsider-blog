BODY:
Because I subscribe to nearly a hundred different site feeds, I am often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that I receive. Overlook the reader for a day even, and I'm stuck with 5-600 entries to read.

A few friends say, "Son, just skip that and go from today. That's ridiculous." Arguably, they are correct. But I just can't let go, and there's a real reason for it beyond some obsessive compulsive disorder I may or may not possess: There are gems hidden in that pile, and a few feeds consistently provide great stuff. 

Case in point: Jason Kottke. He's been around forever, really. I remember I stopped reading his page for a while, though I can't remember why. I know that I've always been envious of his endeavors (you know, constantly improving the site, having a huge following, leaving employia to work on his blog as a job, that kind of thing) so that may have been a factor. Regardless, I will NEVER "mark all as read" on his feed. It's like flushing money down the drain. 

Here's what I'm talking about; selected gems from the last couple weeks or so:

</ul>

So let's call a spade a spade. I heart Kottke. He sets a standard I aspire to. I don't normally call out my link sources, but this one is way overdue. Thanks Jason, for a great site.
