[As is my custom](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2012/02/change-your-mind.htm), each year* I come up with a new motto or rallying cry for the road ahead. They usually end up as my Twitter bio, and this year's is a bit of a departure from those of years prior. You see, my motto this year (following up on [my last entry](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2014/01/habits-and-mistakes.htm)) is to *make more mistakes*. 

I'm not planning to embark on a life of crime and lawlessness, but I do find three real reasons why I should make more mistakes in 2014:

* **More successes require more failures.** It's a numbers game. If I want to be successful, I need to learn from mistakes and just keep trying as much as possible. The number of people who see sustained success from their first attempts is basically zero, and if you're not failing you probably aren't trying new things. 
* **More mistakes yield less trauma.** If you've never had anything go wrong, you're very likely spending much of your efforts to protect that record--instead of using it to push further. Your first failure can be very traumatic, but your 50th failure is likely to hurt a lot less. Basically an aversion to failure can actually be a major obstacle to actually getting to success. Make sure you're not resisting the cure because you're afraid of the needle. 
* **Mistakes require grace.** When we are on top of the world, it can be easy to be unforgiving of those struggling at the bottom. Falling ungraciously and having to dust ourselves off reminds us that humility and graciousness is well received. It also connects us at a human level to so many more than can be connected to from our untouchable seat of perfection. Making mistakes makes us more dependent on each other and more willing to help others making mistakes. Finally, it speaks directly to the need for a "[finisher of our faith](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A2&version=KJV)." All those haughty Christians must have forgotten that we've all sinned and fallen short--and are in desperate need of grace from our God and from each other. 

So this year, as scary as it may sound, I'll be trying to make more mistakes. At the end of the year I hope to be smarter, better versed, more adaptable and, ultimately, more successful.

*Last year's motto was "Persist." I'm certain I wrote about this, but it seems to have been lost along with [all the other things](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnlLhq1kW10).
