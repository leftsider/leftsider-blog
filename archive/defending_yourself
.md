BODY:
This morning I participated in a dream where I was walking down a narrow street of rowhouses, all red and blue and yellow and in good condition. I could tell that this was a very urban area, but I felt no lack of safety--it felt like a good neighborhood.

I walked out of one house and up the street to another house where my wife was. I did something there, which I can't remember, and then decided that i needed to stop back by the first house. 

On the way back, there were two people walking down the street. I moved quickly, but I saw one move in my direction to initiate contact. "Hey, do you have any change to spare?" The guy asked. 

"No, I don't carry change," I said as I paused, stopped to look at him, and shrugged. I find myself doing that often because I feel that many homeless or struggling people suffer from a deficit of attention; no one even pays them mind until they interject themselves, and then they ignore. I never carry change because I spend what's in my pockets and that's bad.

 I think he didn't anticipate me focusing on him directly because my pause caused him to overstep me and cross my path. Upon doing this, he slowed down to stay in close proximity to me.

I saw him reach for something in his pocket. He was actually fumbling around quite a bit, so I wondered what he could be pulling out....

A gun? too small.
A pack of cigarettes? possibly.
Something to or show me? It's not impossible, but I really don't have time to sit and chat. I pick up my pace.

As I overtake him, I see in the corner of my eye that it was a knife. A silver butterfly knife. I groan inwardly. Are you serious? Is this guy gonna try and stick me after I told him the honest truth? He skips a step to keep up and then he taps my arm with the blade.

"Hey," he says, half mumbling," you got any change for a knife?"

I slow down just a bit to look at him directly, but I keep moving to show him I'm not stopping for this crap and also to put me closer to my destination. "I don't keep change bro, All I have is this wallet and this phone..." 

I reach into my pockets and pull out my wallet and phone, one in each hand, raising upward as if I were going to assume a pose of surrender. But, for some reason, as soon as my hands were out of my pockets, my leg moves like a flash in a powerful attempt to kick the living daylights out of this jerk.

That was when I woke up. My leg was off the bed. Luckily for Fru, I was facing out when I lashed out--otherwise she may have acquired a really nasty bruise this morning.

It made me think though. I live my life expecting nothing but good from all people. I am not naive enough to think that there is nothing bad in the world, but I like the idea of being surprised that my fellow man has done wrong instead of being surprised that my counterpart has done something good. While this has helped me to build a positive aura around me wherever I go, it isn't a bulletproof vest.

The same is true online. We create blogs that express our ideas, make connections through social networks and internet communication tools. We live a virtual life that expects that everyone will abide by the rules. But what happens when someone doesn't?

Thinking about my dream, I realized that I reacted much more strongly that I would have anticipated. My assumption is that the fueling factor of my action was my deep deep disappointment in the choices this aggressor made. I didn't dislike him as a person, and I didn't really feel like I was preparing to fight. I just wanted to disarm him and then explain how stupid what he did was. I wanted to help him, like I feel towards all people, but there was a distinct need for a rearrangement of variables.

Is this how I would respond to a similar act in the real world? I have no clue. I do feel that my feelings in that situation, however, were indicative of my perspective on things at a subconscious level and may shed light on the foundations of my thinking. How would this translate into a response for online assault? That's what I'm thinking about now.
