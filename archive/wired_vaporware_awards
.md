<blockquote>Pull back the red curtain and dim the lights. It's the 9th annual presentation of the Wired News Vaporware Awards, our ode to the year's top technology products promised, hyped and scheduled, but not delivered.</blockquote>

I look forward to reading these every year. The number one position is so far out of reach....Now that Vista has arrived I wonder if anything can compete with that track record.  Pure geek hilarity.
