	If anyone's ever wanted to vacation well but not spend a lot, southeast asia is your spot. We've had nothing but great hotels at dirt-cheap prices. <br />
<br />
Our first hotel was Perak Lodge. Right between ethnic Little India and shop-tastic Bugis, this serene lodging cost us around US$50 a night!
