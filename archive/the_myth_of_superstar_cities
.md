<blockquote>Over the past 15 years, it has been opportunistic newcomers — Houston, Charlotte, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Riverside — that have created the most new jobs and gained the most net domestic migration. In contrast there has been virtually negligible long-term net growth in jobs or positive domestic migration to places like New York, Los Angeles, Boston or the San Francisco Bay Area.</blockquote>

Sounds like something I've been thinking. Obviously, it's supported more credibly than <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/08/finally_got_away_for_a.htm">my meanderings</a>. Still, I wish there was a way to recognize the potential of an upstart city so that you could cash in early and take advantage. Of course, if there was, I'm sure I wouldn't be the only one cashing in; perhaps that's why I can't get a hold of that algorithm. :)
