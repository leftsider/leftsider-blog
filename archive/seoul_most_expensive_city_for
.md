<blockquote>Seoul has been judged the most expensive city for expatriates living in Asia by ECA International, a human resource firm in Singapore. It ranked the capital eighth in the world. Seoul leads the field in Asia due to a strong won coupled with overall price increases of local products and services.</blockquote>
