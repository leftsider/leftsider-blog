	KL used to be the capital but it has recently been moved down south a bit. Still, this is the place to be and see. <br />
<br />
After recoop'ing from the trip up, I took Fru down to the strip for a little shopping, then we went to the KL tower for a fantastic night view of the city.<br />
<br />
The tower staff fitted us with headphones and we were told all about what we were seeing....even if we weren't really interested in knowing exactly. Lasting just a second longer than it should've it kinda prevented any "ooh"s and "aah"s I would have observed from Fru. Drat. still very nice.<br />
<br />
Here you have a pic, from the tower, of the Petronas towers. These, until a few years ago, were the tallest structures in the world (incidentally, the KL Tower seems equally high due to being on a hill).
