I had a plan, but life keeps getting in the way.

I figured that if I could do classes Monday through Thursday  from 6-10 if I just went in to work earlier. Seven in the morning to 5pm would give me time to get between locations with minimal tardiness. Since I live really close to work I could still squeeze in 6-7 hours a night for sleep, which was all I was used to anyway.

What I hadn't calculated was homework/reading time, and since this is a summer session they really pile it in. But Fridays and Sundays were free so I figured I'd just have to forego my usual social lifestyle as a tribute to dedicated study. 

So if everything is set to work, why do I keep getting sidetracked? Meetings with the financial advisor, short notice parental visits, weekend trips....it's all very counterproductive. It would seem that Leftsider is the only outlet that hasn't really required my presence, so let me say thanks to all of you who have endured the slowdown. 

Enjoy a few links in appreciation.
