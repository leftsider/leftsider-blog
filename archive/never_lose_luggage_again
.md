Why stick the cost to the airline or airport? Add the dime to the cost of the luggage, with the RFID tag placed in a damage-resistant, universal location. 

There is no need for the manufacturer--or the purchaser, for that matter--to ever know the number so it would never be a privacy/tracking issue. As long as the numbers assigned are unique enough that two bags won't have the same number in a random airport, I think that would be problem solved. What do you think?
