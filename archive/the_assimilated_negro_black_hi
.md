Ah, February. My favorite month of dread. The time of year when most of the superficially minded nation to which I pledge allegiance spend four weeks talking about what old, and often dead, black americans did for the US. A time for people to remember, "Oh yeah! You're not just my friend and a cool guy, but you're black too! WOW!!!" A time for tributes.....from McDonalds.

Without going into why this pomp and circumstance has no greater tangible relevancy that of valentine's day, let me tell you that I'm not a big fan (note, that does not make me a hater, Kim). Despite living, eating, and breathing this stuff as a child, I think I've had my media full.

Thankfully TAN has brought some joy to my black history month with his perspective. For the first time in a while (which I've been meaning to complain about, TAN) the assimilated negro makes me laugh and remember that it's genius like this that makes us worthy participants in a global community.
