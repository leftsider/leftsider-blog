After a bad nap, I decided to throw something mellow on while the sun slipped below the mountains. Searching through my (painfully limited) collection I decided on the equally off-kilter noodlings of Yesterday's New Quintet.

YNQ has always been one of those groups that I was proud to have accidentally stumbled upon. While record hunting (ah, another lost pleasure!) I picked up a YNQ EP mostly because of the catchy name. Taking the record for a spin, I was groovin off of "Papa," "Uno Esta" and "Life's Angles." I snagged it with a couple other records and called it a day.

Funny thing is, I never really worked that hard to find out more about them. I ended up downloading the entire "Angles Without Edges" album, but never looked any further than remembering the record label for future crate digs.

Previously, In a totally unrelated record hunt, Aou dropped a sample CD in my bag from a guy named Quasimoto. We listened to the 3 tracks on the way home and it was definitely some off-the-wall next-level stuff. But it had tight beats and decent rhymes, so we kept it in the car for the longest.

Quasimoto was just too odd to not Google. I soon found out that it was an alias for a guy also known as Madlib. Madlib....isn't that the guy who's famous in underground for making all his stuff on the $300 SP-303? I'll have to keep an eye out for this guy.....

Fast Forward. I flip the YNQ record cover over and read the back....Five guys with interesting musical backgrounds converging in one premium blend. Wait....Madlib's involved in this? Wow, that man's got some range. I'm gonna have to pay attention to this guy for real. 

Fast Forward. You know, listening to these bumbling beats and lopsided loops on Saturday evening, I decided to finally sort through this whole thing. I plopped down in front of the computer and googled <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1544352,00.html">the YNQ album</a>, then Madlib.

Guess what? Madlib is both Madlib and Quas on the Quasimoto CD. Guess what else? He's ALL FIVE MEMBERS of YNQ. Dude. Who the heck makes their own quintet by themselves? And why is it so darn good???? I'm in awe to the talent.

In addition to these revelations, I found out a lot of other projects he's involved with. Impressive. A musical gem hidden even under his own creations. That's pretty baddass. I'm too jealous right now.
