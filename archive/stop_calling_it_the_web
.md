On the plane to London I did a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Mapping">mindmapping</a> and came up with a new idea that I thought I'd share. Starting now, I will work to remove the word "web" from my conversation about computers and the internet. Here's why.

When I think of a web, I think of a spider. She puts up a web to ensnare unsuspecting bugs. These bugs wander around, get caught, and can't get away. The spider then sucks them of all life, leaving their hollow carcasses wrapped and blowing in the wind. She must do this, for if she didn't, she would die.

Does this sound like the internet that you use?

It was a nice analogy when things were small and all about lines and dots that connect. It was barely OK when people used the internet for placing static information in a billboard-like display (you're not still doing this, <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/homepagegoals">are you</a>?). But now, as we step out of the hoo-ha of "Web2.0" and into the actual application of a collaborative, user defined/defining, customizable interaction with the internet, it is way beyond its freshness date and must be replaced.

Internet, actually, is a wonderful word that is much more aptly suited (see? This isn't me trying to coin a new buzzword!). It combines the concept of a network with the prefix implication that things cross boundaries and connect separated worlds. It is a wonderful to say what the internet is: A medium that takes information to infinite locations and allows us to virtually take that journey as well.

What do we encounter when we take that journey? Increasingly, we are seeing the real lives of many people and the issues and situations of many more. We receive this information and utilize it to gain and awareness all--not just our own, not just those who are online. 

Other people are doing this. <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2007/07/todays_office_2.html">Nokia</a> is doing this. Nokia is a company that sells mobile devices. They are following people from around the world in order to understand them better before offering services/solutions to them. Why wouldn't a religious organization want to develop the same level of understanding? Wouldn't it make sense to know who you're talking to and what their situation is before you offer them a solution? Perhaps if we did <a href="http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2006/11/nokia_world_opk.html">figures like these</a> wouldn't have been so eye-opening last week. 

The other importance to the bilateral communication that the internet allows is not just what the story is but how they tell it. What happens to us theoretically happens to everyone, but how we share those events, ideas, and perceptions is what gives us identity. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/identitymatters/">Identity matters</a>, especially when the internet is a real part of your life. And as our online and offline identities merge (as a result of social networks, we have to realize the importance of truth/untruth, storytelling and historical revision to personal identity (<a href="http://infovore.org/talks-pdf/telling-stories-print.pdf">pdf link</a>). We've learned this in tangible living; the internet is developing through these lessons <a href="http://sarahcpr.com/?p=45">as we speak</a>.

Yes, this collaborative, self-defining nature is a threat to organizational control, but it is necessary for involvement in what is becoming a universal norm. Big media has realized this with amazing rapidness and made changes to move to a more accommodating strategy. I think it is time for all of us to catch the wave.
