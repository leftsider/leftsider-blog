<blockquote>Over and over, today's culture not only reinforces that everyone is creative, but also that we have to be creative in order to be fully realized and fulfilled beings. We are told we need to have creative work, and that our creativity is the key to innovation at our work. This is true even as the number of cubicle-bound paper-pushing jobs ever seems to multiply, and as fewer and fewer jobs really require much creativity. We are told, and have bought the notion, that creativity is now the solution to every problem, and that without creativity we are destined for failure. And having bought into how essential is creativity, we end up constantly seeking validation--from the culture at large or from anyone who will give it--for what we want to hear: that we are creative, essential, important people who are valid and crucial to the working of modern civilization. </blockquote>

An intellectual, articulate (wait, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/weekinreview/04clemetson.html">is he black?</a>) perspective of much the same concept <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/09/namaste-this-is-sparta.html">I noted earlier</a> from Gym Jones. Hmm; is there a new revolution coming from the American heartland?
