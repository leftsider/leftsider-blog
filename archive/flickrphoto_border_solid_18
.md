	Sentosa had beach and touristy attractions, but some parts made me feel like I had just stepped into an Indiana Jones movie. Just waiting for a giant snake to fall on us as we're being chased by natives.<br />
<br />
Granted if the natives of singapore were chasing us, you'd definitely see their tribal markings of fantastic highlights in their hair as they brandished their moblie phones and Vuitton bags. This is both the male and female native, btw. :)
