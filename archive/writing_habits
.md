#Happy New Year.

As 2013 came to a close, I found myself focused on deeper, more involved character flaws that have as much right to be called a part of me as anything good or distinctive I might prefer to be known for. And as difficult as it might be to self-evaluate and accept a losing record at addressing these attributes, it is certainly not made easier when you live in what is possibly the most accepting place in the world, working in the most wonderful environment you can imagine on the most ephemeral of things--the tweet.

140 characters is not enough to truly assess and detail the self. It was not intended for this purpose. I find myself occasionally opening a journal and writing (in cursive!) just to slow my mind to the speed of my writing and focus that extra bandwidth on truly investigating my thoughts. A cursory glance through the archives of this blog and you'll know that it once served this purpose; perhaps it should again.

Writing is cathartic; it is also revelatory. Moving back to more regular blogging reinforces my resolve and develops a healthy habit of reflection.

I look forward to writing again. Perhaps this year I'll be better--through writing--on the other side.
