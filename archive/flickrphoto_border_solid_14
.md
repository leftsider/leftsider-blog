<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	After feeding monkeys, it was decided that we should feed ourselves. <br />
<br />
Our tour companions were from Holland and Russia (Siberia!). They were quite friendly, but the fact that we all had our native tongues and our spouses with us limited group conversation somewhat. Luckily there was plenty of food to stuff our empty mouths with. <br />
<br />
After eating, we went to another part of the river you see behind us. We all were here just for this moment...
