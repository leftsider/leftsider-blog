There's a lot involved in that change, and it's something deliberate that I'm doing rather than something *environmental*. It's been a long time coming but the momentum is building.

It started with the harsh reality of deception by nearly every person I know. Even today my mind boggles at the expanse of friends, colleagues, and loved ones who seemingly lied to my face day in and day out. Not that they lied; they just didn't tell me the truth--and that really hurt me to my core.

I hated the world. What few reasons I had to live a life of goodness and civility were enshrouded by a thick, dark, desire to reject everything and ooze my brooding spirit throughout my world through base and carnal, vindictive machinations.

After a few months the darkness tempered. I decided that when I cut my hair I would die--to be reborn as a new person, one who was not fond of the original man or his vulnerabilities or his well-meaning friends. One who did as he felt and pulled no punches. Unfortunately, old habits die hard, and I lacked the reserve to be as badass as I had hoped.

Yet the process has begun, and as we approached 2010 I became increasingly determined to focus my frustrations, forging a new character. A new year, a new decade, and having just passed thirty, I wanted to make the alignment of these new milestones count. Today, I am truly different--though not yet fully adapted--and I feel a much heavier, more intense focus on things.

Many people around me don't like when I get too serious. They are accustomed to the easy-going, carefree, fun-loving person that I was. I still love fun, and I am not fast-paced, but life is too short and this world to complicated to not establish a bubble of cognizance in this sea of oblivion. 

So the "honesty, craftsmanship, good intent" motto I've assigned for this year is a very deceptive one. It is a waypoint between the man I was and the man I want to be. It shows the dreams and ideals mixed like blood and water with reality and end results. 

I no longer live in a dreamworld. My life is what I make it. Though life can be brutal, I refuse to return in kind. That is the kind of man I am.
