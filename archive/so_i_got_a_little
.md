BODY:
So I got a little weepy about leaving today. Even though we don't actually leave until saturday morning. While it seems a little ahead of schedule for tears, actually works out well since I'll be less likely to be all sobby getting on a plane.

For the record, I did not cry at all in the week before leaving the US. That's profound. The week before I wept, but that was because it was the last time i would see the house I grew up in; it got sold the next month. That's the last comparable weeping session; next session would be when they took Iva. And I can't remember weeping before that.

I like the word weeping, and I think it's underused. I wasn't injured or in pain, there was nothing that I was particularly frustrated about or anything like that. That's what I associate with crying. Something that is seemingly not of your intention. Weeping implies thoughtful sorrow; something recognized, accepted, yet still solemnly sad. Yeah, that's what it was.

I've got a lot of memories here, good and bad. I've got some accomplishments, some uncompleted  goals, and some things I never got around to. I've grown an enormous amount of respect for a people. I'm leaving a lot of that behind. I'm not happy about it, so I let one go, semi-privately. Frulwinn was around and kept following me around, sensing someting amiss. But you know, a guy needs solitary time to reflect on these things. There was nothing wrong; instead I was making everything right within myself.

I feel a lot better mentally now. Unfortunately, I'm feeling pretty weak otherwise. Perhaps my body is physically objecting to the exodus. I hit the 사우나 and 찜질방 this morning with mixed results. Tried staying warm but i'm still nursing a head and body ache. maybe I'll call it an early night.

Very touching man. Good luck with the movement transition, and I hope the both of you have a safe trip home after your vacation in Japan is it? Anyhow take it easy dude.. I know I wouldn't be as easy with a 15 hour plus flight ahead of me.. But thats for different but obvious reasons.
