So I guess this post is long overdue.

Fru and I are going back to the US in March. We'll say goodbye to Korea on March 4, spend a few days in Japan, then arrive in the states on the 8th. Our time living in Asia will, at that point, have ended. 

I know that it's a necessary move. Frulwinn is tired of teaching English; I need to return to employia and continue my academic pursuits. It has always been an element of the plan; so why do I feel reservation about it?

Initially, I assumed it was because of a socio-cultural void. Everyone and everything we've experience in the last year will be unknown, and everything in that same period that has happened stateside for our families, friends, and communities doesn't exist to us. People have children that didn't exist before. People who I know are now dead--so many, in fact, that I'm not sure I remember everyone who has died. No concept of superbowls or judge confirmations. And no one there has perspective on APEC, Hwang Woo-suk, Yaksuni, or X-ë§¨. For the first time, I get a more realistic idea of what it'd actually be like for a person to step in and out of an alternate dimension (like all those X-men comic books I read as a youth).

But, more recently, I've started to realize an even deeper tie. When Fru and I return, we'll be leaving a place that we lived for 14 months. Not that long. I lived with Joey in Silver Spring, however, for only 16 months. That experience impacted me in many ways that I'm likely to never forget it. In the same way, the things that I left and was separated from, the things which I may never see or experience again, and everything else hangs right here in Daegu. Sits and watches me pack up and leave.

Daegu has become as much of a home as any other place I've lived in. So naturally when I leave my home, my friends, my special places and my familiarities behind....well, I lose quite a bit. This doesn't change just because I'm moving back to something more familiar.

So...time keeps going faster and I'm procrastinating again--my trivial hope that if I accomplish nothing, nothing will change. But they will.

I'm preparing to say goodbye, Daegu. Please be gentle; breaking up is hard to do.
