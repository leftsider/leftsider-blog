BODY:
There are two reasons why I cut my hair. The first is that I was tired of long hair. I never wanted long hair, I just wanted a hairstyle I didn't have to do anything to. Somewhere along the way, I adopted the persona and maintained it until now, when it was just unreasonable. Think about how many people have had the same hairstyle for 12 years and still are considered fashionable, and you have reason enough to change.<div><br /></div><div>The other reason I didn't realize until after I had cut it. In fact, I didn't realize it until about two weeks ago. Walking on empty streets in an evening rain, I realized I cut my hair to become more like everyone else.</div><div><br /></div><div>At that moment, I realized that I was no longer interested in being better, cooler, more connected, less forgettable. <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/2043292763">Social climbing was suddenly repulsive, recognizing that the footholds were other people being stepped on.</a> Every hope of achieving something that another could not was preventing me from the dream of a world that was unequivocally accepting to all.</div><div><br /></div><div>That night, I refrained from tweeting a possibly&nbsp;sacrilegious comment about<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_fig"> searching for a tree to make my enlightenment complete</a>. It seemed as if puzzle pieces had fallen into place, revealing a picture with greater meaning.</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>My interest in <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2008/04/abandoning-status.htm">removing status</a>, and in being equal or empathetic to all</li><li>My advocacy of public transportation, not only for resource-friendly transport but for a leveling of current socioeconomic isolation and real exposure to the everyday life of others</li><li>My <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/1978187171">recent focus</a> on a personal sartorial style that was not label-based or class-indicative</li><li>My continuing reflection on <a href="http://wiki.leftsider.com/tiki-index.php?page=truthAndCulture">truth and its pervasiveness</a> when stripped of culture-specific tradition</li><li>Countless initiatives to bring people together, and to share experiences with a larger audience.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Some had asked, "why did you cut your hair? You just look normal now; you don't stand out," and with each prodding I came closer to belting out the reality, which was even unknown to me--I no longer want to stand out, because standing apart prevents me from being interconnected with all humanity.</div></div>

I wonder if I'll feel the same way when I'm old, gray and forgettable. (test comment)
