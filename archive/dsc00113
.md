<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	We took lots of food pics, but I won't bore you with them. I'll just show this one now because this is typical and traditional "comida costarricense."<br />
<br />
It's called cassado, and it consists of rice and beans unmixed, plantain, and either beef (pictured) or fish. We ate so much of this type of meal you would not believe. I, however, never got tired of it.
