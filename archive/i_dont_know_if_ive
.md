I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but part of my responsibilities in my current position has made me assistant editor of a quarterly denominational magazine. It's weird being an assistant editor, but hey, it beats my official position title.

Today I sat at lunch and was joined  by two other individuals who were involved with denominational publications. As it turned out, they also were both assistant editors at their repsective rags. I decided, as a result of that conversation, that I need to be more careful so that I don't turn into a one-trick blowhard.
