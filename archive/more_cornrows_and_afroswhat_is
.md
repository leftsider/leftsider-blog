BODY:
This weekend we actually went out. And when I say "went out" in reference to a weekend, I am saying that we did not get home until well into the next day.

This is something that I love doing, but unfortunately it's the first successful time I've had an opportunity to since I've moved here. Partly because of location, partly because of timing, partly because of scheduling conflicts--and completely to my chagrin.

This time though, we had already made plans to be out late. We were hanging with a party that isn't known for wee-hours activities, so we didn't expect much. But after the participants exchanged farewells, Fru and I and a friend wandered towards the scene to get a taxi. Then we thought, hey, we're already here....

Two hours later all three of us are on the stage in front of the DJ, dancing like crazy, hyping up the crowd and having a good time. It was a hip-hop styled club, but these days I can't be picky. I think I might faint from joy anyway if I found a place that spun some nice House. 

Faded to sleep around 4...*sigh* Good times. Kinda made me miss home, but definitely quenched a thirst. When's the next outing? ;)
