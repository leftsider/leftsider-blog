BODY:
Lately I've been finding myself completely baffled by the sincere innocence of others. It is as if, despite their age, they have not seen the world for what it is; their actions and opinions carry hope in humanity that just seems downright unreasonable to me.

Perhaps I look with jaded eyes. It could be that what I have seen enough of to consider normal is actually closer to the basest of man than I perceive. But even if it is, how could I go back to living a life where these depths don't even exist?

Perhaps this is the blight of sin Adam and Eve experienced. The Bible says that upon eating the fruit, their eyes were opened. Once eyes are opened, they have seen--even if they are shut again. I didn't understand that when I was a kid; I understand now.

What I have seen means my eyes will never ever really be closed.
