	Ok so Fru has tons of family in Cali, but I got my peeps as well!<br />
<br />
Before watching the ball drop with the cousins, we drove out to Redlands/Loma Linda and hooked up with some of my old schooltime buddies. I knew three were there, but it seems California has a weird magnetic attraction. :)<br />
<br />
These guys chimed in with Fru's relatives: "You guys need to move over here!" I'm starting to be swayed...
