Does this sound like something I'd say or what?

"I personally do not frequent places many places where English teachers hang out. One of the reasons is that I get easily frustrated watch�a bunch of�grubby, unkempt, long greasy-haired men and other people that look like they crawled out of the shallow end of the gene pool and into Darwin%u2019s waiting room gripe about how they are treated badly at work.� They should be lucky they are allowed to work looking like that.� I think all institutes should have strict dress codes.� However, suggesting a written dress code is unnecessary as every Korean knows how to dress for work.� It%u2019s just the foreigners how walk around with the attitude of %u201CI%u2019ve just got to be me.� What does it matter how I look if I do my job well?%u201D� The short answer is that to Koreans, it matters A LOT what people look like.� You as a foreigner are more noticeable and should therefore be trying extra hard to get the respect you so desparately want, but so seldom deserve.� Appearance and attitude go a long way to help avoid problems and to help resolve problems that do occur."
