Fru and I were talking, and we noticed that nearly all of my friends and regular associates are either only children or the youngest sibling. There are a lot of characteristics that younger brothers or sisters possess, and we wondered if those traits were naturally attracted to the characteristics that I possess. I, of course, am an older brother.

I think the thing that makes me the most conscious of this phenomenon is the sheer amount of questions I field. Questions about life, relationships, work, philosophy, religion and health. Questions that, honestly, I probably am not qualified to answer and that for me, annoyingly, were time-consuming, researched arrivals rather than short, concise and packaged answers. 

To say I feel cheated would be accurate.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/science/21cnd-sibling.html?ex=1184040000&en=1a14817138e1ab5e&ei=5070">Recent studies</a> have implied that for this very reason, older siblings have a slight advantage in IQ. To be honest, I'd gladly exchange three points in IQ for a mentor or adviser, someone to whom I could ask the questions I'm pondering. 

In this next-generation, collaborative, internet-enabled world that I promote, it would seem that I'm collaborating with others more than they are collaborating with me. <em>Note to self</em>: find way to implement balance in collaboration philosophies.
