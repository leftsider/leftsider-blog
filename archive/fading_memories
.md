As we get older, our memories are sweeter; and as they grow sweeter, the more they slip from us. We search our mental recesses with intensity, yet eventually we can barely sort out the storyline. And then, it's gone forever. 

Part of a conversation with my grandmother-

Leftsider says: 
   I was thinking about pop pop the other day. I was kinda cloudy and the wind was picking up, and I remembered how pop pop said if the leaves on the trees across the street all blew the same direction it usually meant rain. I remember that actually working, so I've always looked at trees when I wonder if it's going to shower.

Leftsider says: 
   I don't know if that works for Korea, though. ;)

Leftsider says: 
   That was from way back when I stayed with you guys for the summer.

QUEEN MARGIE OF HARRINGTON says: 
   Your Dad went to Virginia Beach this week end, Kim kept house :) You know I don't remember you staying with us one summer.

Leftsider says: 
   WHAT?????

Leftsider says: 
   That was one of the best summers I ever had

Leftsider says: 
   I stayed with you guys and then went home on the weekends.

Leftsider says: 
   maybe around 8 years old.

Leftsider says: 
   wow. close to 20 years ago. I can see why you wouldn't remember.

EXTENDED BODY:
QUEEN MARGIE OF HARRINGTON says: 
   Where was Kim?

Leftsider says: 
   I don't know...

Leftsider says: 
   daycare?

Leftsider says: 
   she was three, so.

Leftsider says: 
   I sometimes wonder about those days, whether there was something about tthe whole thing I didn't know since I was small.

Leftsider says: 
   But that was the times when I used to skateboard up and down the street with the kids that lived in the houses next to you (which are long gone now) and when I got hooked on donahue, games shows, and some soaps. I watched bold and the beautiful and guiding light. 

Leftsider says: 
   going to the sale with pop pop on tuesdays and fridays

Leftsider says: 
   maybe even picking  you up from work at the state offices...I can remember that a little.

QUEEN MARGIE OF HARRINGTON says: 
   Pop Pop remembers going to the sale on tuesdays and fridays . So pop pop was the baby sitter. I don't remember you ever being out in the street playing with the kids and especially  with a skateboard

Leftsider says: 
   I can't remember any particular day or series of events, just little things that stand out. 

Leftsider says: 
   oh mom mom....you guys are getting old.
