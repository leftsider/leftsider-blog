So here are some of the ideas I've come up with to put the "In" back in international living--cause heaven knows I've been feeling so "out."

EXTENDED BODY:
Supermap!!!
One of the things that's both interesting and a little frustrating about Daegu 시내 (Downtown) is that is't really tight and twisty with less signage the further you get in. By the time you get to the hotspots there are no signs at all--so finding something you found before or telling someone where to find something is impossible.

So I've decided to use a portion of my free time to make a Superfuture-styled map. I lay out the streets, mark them, and then spend time marking the things that I think should be marked. The fact that their reason for making superfuture maps is related to my reason, I think it's a project that's more than just cool factor.

Korean Classes!
Yeah it's about time. At the Daegu Tourist Information Center yesterday, I finally got some info about Korean classes for foreigners. While there are no actual korean language institutes in Daegu that I'm aware of, all of Daegu's universities have korean language classes for foreigners. They range from approximately 200,000 to 1,000,000 won and have classes for seven weeks or more. 

As this will probably still be cheaper and less hassle than finding, enrolling in, and paying for Korean classes at Maryland, I think I'll be taking advantage of this one in the near future. I'll keep you posted. 

Another reason I'm interested in this is that it will give me an opportunity to meet my own set of people--people who are not affiliated with SDA language institute or my church. Most likely I'll meet mostly foreigners, but I'm ok with that I guess. If a foreigner is paying bucks to learn the language, they'll probably have some Korean friends and plan on being around for a bit. 

Haunting!!!
Haunting is a big pastime of mine. I can't remember if I gave it this name or not, but it's basically just wandering around with no particular goal or destination in mind; it's all about the journey, not the endpoint. It's great for finding hidden gems or nice photos.

I haven't done it much since I've been here because of a few reasons. First, things open late here, so the morning is out. If I start to early, I have nowhere to stop in for a drink or something until 10 or 11, around the same time that the department stores open.

Second, afternoons leave me wandering around a sea of 아지마, with schoolkids plauging the early afternoon. Both ogle me mercilessly, which makes me the rare gem and my reason for haunting is totally taken from me. 

Third, night haunting (my favorite) is perfect but costly. I live outside of the downtown area and the subway in isn't scheduled to be operational till September. That leaves the buses (which stop around 10) and the taxis (which raise prices around 10). 

Even so, I like this pastime enough to try and see it through. Plus it will be very helpful for finding items to place on my supermap. I'll have to figure out which time is least inconvenient.
