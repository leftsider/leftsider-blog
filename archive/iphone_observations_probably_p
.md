While I'm not so sure that the iPhone is the revolution it claims to be (or perhaps it is a revolution while I'm looking for an <em>evolution</em>), This post does point out a lot of the things I think are important about this new toy.

Here is a perspective that has some of the same reservations that I do. I think if you put these two post together you'd be somewhere close to where I am about the product currently. Yes, iPhone is cool; but is it <em>really cool</em>?
