<blockquote>The cold, hard truth about the Bush administration’s strategy of “surging” additional U.S. forces into Iraq is that it could work. Insurgencies are rarely as strong or successful as the public has come to believe. Iraq’s various insurgent groups have succeeded in creating a lot of chaos. But they’re likely not strong enough to succeed in the long term. Sending more American troops into Iraq with the aim of pacifying Baghdad could provide a foundation for their ultimate defeat, but only if the United States does not repeat its previous mistakes.</blockquote>

There was an Economist piece recently that said largely the same thing. I tend to agree. I wonder if most people are really thinking about Iraq when they make their assumptions on the war. I'm not really sure what they're thinking about.
