Just finished talking with Walter, who is on a mission trip from Korea to Japan. It's a holiday in Japan right now, so they are relegated to sightseeing until the festivities finish. 

Cesar left a message on his Myspace page, sharing the fun and adventure he's experiencing on his mission trip to Belize. Despite what he considered to be abject primitivity, he apparently is well connected and asks that we keep in touch via email while he's gone. 

My coworkers Mervyn and Mark arrived last week from a 3-week mission trip to Philippines. Lots of fresh fruit and tropical weather, hard work and over 100 baptisms. Of course, they also got to tour and see some sights while there as well. 

My in-laws practically met them in the airport, leaving for a mission trip to Kenya early monday morning. There they will help to build a parsonage next to the church that was built last trip, so that it will encourage the Union to place a pastor and his family in that village. Many pastors in Africa have numerous churches, but it's always nice to have your church be his "home church."

Building relationships with the people is nice as well. That's what Onyx thought was the best part of his recent mission trip from Korea to Mongolia. He worked through an interpreter to talk to the people--though he naturally is a magnet for children--and hope to keep in contact with the few people he managed to build ties with while he was there.

Me? Well, I just sit in this cubicle, then go to class, then go home....
