When I was a child, we were still in the era of "speak when spoken to." From my parents, I'd expect a sharp look that signaled that my mouth was leading me into imminent danger. Then I'd be told to go play in another room or something. This was fortunate, since I knew plenty of kids who would have instead just received a swift backhand.

By the end of my youth, however, I already noticed a greater tolerance for loose-lipped juveniles. Perhaps as a result of the "Kids Say the Darnedest Things" mentality, people actually smiled when kids made off-color comments.  It is to this faltering stance that I pin the blame for bad, mouthy kids.
