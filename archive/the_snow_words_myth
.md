<blockquote>You may think it couldn't possibly be that a language could have words with such complex meaning, but let me just add this. I once browsed for a while in the wonderful Comparative Eskimo Dictionary and came to the conclusion that it looked as if you should be able to make up a single word that would mean "They were wandering about gathering up lots of stuff that smelled like dead fish." I sent an email to Jerry Sadock, who is a serious Eskimologist, asking whether this was true. Back came an email. It contained one (West Greenlandic Inuit) word.</blockquote>

That is absolutely fascinating. I must admit that I'm guilty of using the snow words myth, though I thought it to be true. It was an interesting anecdote that helped bring non-inclined minds to a somewhat esoteric concept. I guess I'll need to find a new object lesson.
