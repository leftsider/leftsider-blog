	After a wonderful garden tour I had planned to show my wife a wonderful view of Singapore and Malaysia as we made our way to Kuala Lumpur. But, as a bumbling procrastinator, I waited too long.<br />
<br />
When we arrived at the Malaysia Railway Station we were surprised to find that the tickets were all sold for the train to KL. Through a stroke of good fortune, however, we were able to get two tickets from another couple who were exchanging for another day.<br />
<br />
These were overnight seats, however. That means that the trainride was useless; the scenery was pitch black. The first class seating wasn't quite first class, either. <br />
<br />
Anyway, we made it--arriving 6am the next day. As always, my lovely wife just smiles. She was just happy that we got there. <br />
<br />
*sigh* Foiled again. I'm still not done though!
