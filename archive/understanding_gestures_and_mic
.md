<blockquote>Microexpressions are like any other facial expression, but they are very subtle and occur incredibly quickly, coming and going in several hundred milliseconds.

Paul Ekman, largely known for his discovery that many facial expressions of emotion were universal, has been particularly keen on researching microexpressions in recent years.</blockquote>

This is an area that has always fascinated me. It's virtually impossible to completely mask your emotions simply because your body often shares more than just your planned response. Masters of deception have learned not how to hide their expressions, but how to reassign them. 

Good stuff.
