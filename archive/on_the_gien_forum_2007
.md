BODY:
I'd like to thank the Communication department of the Seventh-day Adventist church for inviting me and allowing me to present at their 2007 forum for their Global Internet Evangelism Network. It was a great opportunity to connect with a small but growing set of individuals that are poised to bring the denomination to a fuller potential.

The GIEN forum is an annual meeting that allows the communication directors, media professionals and tech heads of the Adventist church to come together and discuss the internet as a new medium for evangelism. Basically it sounded to me like people wanting to figure out how to use your computer to baptize you. Because let's face it: Adventist pastors and administrators are not anywhere near the top of the list of people you think of when you think of Web2.0. Everything I saw about this thing, including the old website (and even <a href="http://gien.adventist.org">the new one</a>, really), announced the disconnect that the church has with the internet.

If the descriptions of previous attendees are accurate, this year was a real departure from the previous sessions. <a href="http://spectrummagazine.typepad.com/the_spectrum_blog/2007/06/the-spectrum-bl.html">Alexander</a> notes that the list of presenters was relatively young and tech-savvy. It was indeed encouraging to see peers with a bead on the various aspects of the web. We converged and departed in different areas, but it gave the theological postulation squad something new to consider and various sides of the argument.

My personal message at the forum was that the internet is increasingly social. This is because the internet is increasingly becoming our real life. Less and less do you hear the idea of the virtual world because what we do online now has ramifications in the physical, tangible world. If church leaders continue to consider the internet and its communities and philosophies as novel and gameplay, they will soon find themselves alienated from not only those who the wish to reach but also those within who are also increasingly involved with technology.

I presented a workshop, "Developing Adventism in and through Online Social Networks," that gave these administrators a quick primer on what an SNS is, why and how it works, and the pros and cons for both involvement with an existing SNS or a self-made, exclusive SNS setting. Turnout was good, the mood was excellent. I would have fared better if I had brought my old iBook instead of my MacBook; technical shenanigans ate 5-10 minutes of what would have been great discussion.

I made a concentrated effort to push my message in every side conversation. Finally, I think it started to break through. I also kept promoting the ideas of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learnmore/">creative commons</a> and <a href="http://www.studies-observations.com/everyware/">ubiquitous computing</a>, so that these guys can be thinking about tomorrow instead of scrambling about today.

All said, I don't think it could have gone any better. Next year is slated for the African continent. I'm excited about that as I haven't been to Africa in about seven years. I hope to be invited again, based on the success of this iteration. We'll see what happens.

I'll be posting my presentation soon, both here and on the GIEN site. I'll announce it when I get back to the states.

My question to you is...what are the action steps needed to make the church relevant in today's web environment. How do we harness (lol) the resources we have to achieve a presence that attracts a community to take an interest in substantive interaction?

Hey leftsider, 

Good to meet you at the forum. I wish that I could have attended your presentation. Your comment during the panel discussion about importing collaboration models from the creative commons community should get more attention. 

I like what netAdventist is doing in supplying a common platform, but I think that we can push this farther by taking advantage of emerging social networks to intentionally crowdsource the meanings of Adventist culture.

@mrking2
Step one: stop making action steps, especially those that only apply to your organization.
Step two: invest resources (time, thought) into crash-coursing your way to familiarity in current internet trends.
Step three: Actively participate in the community. Which is not the same as copying the community, leeching from the community, etc.

If we do that, the attractiveness will be there. Guaranteed. This is God's message we're talking about here. 


@Alexander
I like that term "crowdsource"; but when has Adventism ever been defined by its adherers? That's dangerous talk there, my new friend. Can you imagine what would happen if Adventism became user-defined?

Greater realization of faith?
More visible Christian action?
Visibility and value outside of our religious sphere?

We really do need to push this farther. I argued to a certain degree in the Ethics breakout group that the internet is a testbed for the upcoming philosophies of society. What they consider to be "the moral and ethical void of the web" is really the foundation upon which new principles will be discovered and tested before implementation in the tangible world. What goes a step further is the NEED for individual interpretations (be they accurate or historical fiction) that build the consensus of who we are. Before I go any further, let me just make this a new blog post.

Lefty,

I consider steps two and three to be helpful action steps because they both suggest taking initiative...hence the whole "action" tag.

You've given some good feedback here. The involvement of social interaction in both a virtual and literal community is an appropriate assimilation of Adventistm with the world outside the SDA bubble. I hope to do my part instead of whining and complaining about the church being behind the times.

Cheers,
Marvin
