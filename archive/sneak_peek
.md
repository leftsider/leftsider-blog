BODY:
For those of you who are subscribed to leftsider (and thus will see this message) you get a sneak peek at the new site: http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider. 

Get in there, look around a bit, and join the fray! Now you can sign in using your Twitter, Google, LJ, Facebook, AIM IDs--along with a slew of others. Once you've signed in you can give yourself a buddy icon and follow other members. The site will keep a track of your comments as well as your comment's comments.

Finally, if you want other's to know the other places you participate on the web, edit your profile by adding "streams" from twitter, flickr, linkedin, or any site RSS feed. I hope you'll be a part of the leftsider transformation. Thanks for hanging around sofar!
