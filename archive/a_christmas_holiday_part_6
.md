	Our entourage was younger and more energetic down in SoCal; On New year's eve the folks in Irvine and San Diego came up and had lunch with the cousins in Glendale, followed by a trip to Santa Monica Promenade to watch the sunset.<br />
<br />
Here is CJ, Jan, Nikki, PJ, Fru, Emily, Eileen and Tav. Not sure why <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/2166080952">Karen</a> isn't in there... other cousins missing as well. So much fam!
