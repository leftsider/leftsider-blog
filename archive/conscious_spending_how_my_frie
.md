<blockquote>A few weeks ago, a couple of friends and I were talking about where we want to travel this year, and one of them said something that surprised me. "You probably wouldn't approve, but I want to go to the Caribbean this year."

Huh? Why wouldn't I approve?

I thought about this in a pensive stare for many moments, taking the form of Rodin's Thinking Man and wishing that I had a pipe and perhaps a tweed jacket. Then I figured it out. Apparently, I'm the personal-finance guy to some people. And, I realized with a sinking feeling, to many people, "the personal-finance guy" means "the guy who tells me I can't do stuff because it costs too much money."

Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, I will call your ass out when you're being stupid about money. But I'm not the finger-wagging parent who tells you not to spend money on lattes. Instead of taking a simplistic "don't spend money on expensive things!!!" view, I believe there's a nuanced approach to spending. Today, I'm going to tell you about 3 friends who are spending lots and lots of money on things you might consider frivolous--like shoes and going out--but I'm going to tell you exactly why I think they're perfectly justified.</blockquote>

Another excellent post. Most people probably won't read through, and that's exactly why they'll be stuck with incorrectly pre-conceived notions about how and why they spend their money.

Great! Well then I've decided to allot $5000 a year to accommodate guests. Maybe not this year, but a year for sure. :)
Come on up!
