BODY:
On helping others:

<blockquote>leftsider: for every 500 questions I answer for you

leftsider: I get about 300 smart remarks

GermanBoy: You want a cookie?

leftsider: 100 thanks

leftsider: and 0 tangible things in return

leftsider: no favors offered

leftsider: or anything

GermanBoy: Yeah I think if we take that route you are already maxed out for the next 5,000,000 questions

leftsider: so I don't feel any guilt about making you wait for answer #501

GermanBoy: you don't feel guilt because you don't have a soul

 leftsider: yeah that too</blockquote>
