BODY:
A lot of interesting things have happened in the last few months, particularly since the trip to England, yet I've written little about them. For many things, it seemed inappropriate to divulge; perhaps it was the timing, or the potential for change, or the sensitive nature of the topic. I just felt it better if I wrote about these things later, if at all.

It has happened with my tweeting as well. I started slowing down, then I realized I was close to my 10,000th tweet and suddenly screeched to a halt, trying to find something novel to do with that milestone. But even after I finally passed that record number, I found myself reticent to share my thoughts as readily. Part of it was that I was in a particular sour mood, part of it was related to confidentiality and industry secret (ha!), while part of it was just finding the *best* things to say rather than *anything*.

It dawned on me that I was caught in self-repression. I was holding my tongue in fear of something--but what was it? Unsurprisingly, it largely was fear of offending my employer--which says two things: I don't think my employer values when I have differing ideas and that I am reliant upon my employer for my well-being.

This is a recipe for unhappiness. While it may not be instantaneous, I'm committing to a return to honesty, transparency; freedom to speak and to disagree. I'll also be working to provide a way that I can continue to live and act honestly no matter the cost. It might sound like I'm saying I'm saving up in case I get fired, but really I'm saying I'm preparing for what's possible; the sky is the limit and the worst thing that could happen to me right now is that I deny an opportunity for fear of being heard.
