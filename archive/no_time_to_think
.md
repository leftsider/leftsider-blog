Along with warm weather comes increased human activity. After New York and the trip to Central America, there was a weekend trip to New Jersey (wedding; Fru went while I stayed home), and the following weekend there was the trip to Virginia for our 10-year high school reunion, which I should probably post about. This weekend we entertained guests from my hometown, giving them the short tour of DC, and helped a friend move into the largest house I've ever had a friend own. 

The future doesn't look much clearer. This weekend is Fru's birthday, an O's game with friends, and a social outing with my coworkers and their families. The following weekend a friend from Daegu has business in Manhattan, so we most likely will head up there. Tentatively, we may be returning with some friends we made in Seoul who will crash at our pad for a few days while touring DC. And on and on the story goes.

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on which side of the looming deadlines and examinations you are on), classes will be finished soon and I'll have a much-needed break from the daily double grind. I hope to slow down enough that I can really be thinking creatively by the time that GIEN comes around. 

I've postulated before that there is a definite <a href="http://wiki.leftsider.com/tiki-index.php?page=deliberateThought">benefit in taking time to think better</a>. At what point do we lose productivity to postulation? At what point does lack of thought create an efficiency nosedive? As I sit here, thoughts swirling, I'm not sure which aspect I should scale down and which I should further engage. Let's hope that May brings us answers.
