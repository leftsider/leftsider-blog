You're Madagascar!

  <i>Lots of people don't really know anything about you, making you 
buried treasure of the rarest kind. &nbsp;You love nature, and could get lost in it 
whenever possible. &nbsp;You're remote and exotic, and the few people who know you 
value whatever they share with you a great deal. &nbsp;For some reason, you really 
like the word &quot;lemur&quot;.
