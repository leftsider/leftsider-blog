*[The following is a series of texts sent I sent to a friend a few days ago. Yes, I sent all of this via text to someone. Minor edits were made to match the new medium.]*


> So I think I told you that every year I come up with a new theme... last year's was to be a star 

> Well, [it started specifically around the sun](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdbZh1IAeRo/) but the fascination expanded 

> That's how we got on the whole "[build a universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3zT-piA1jY)" kick that I hope you're still building 

> But as the year ended I was a little down for various understandable [reasons](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2018/11/leftsider-unemployed.htm)... and then I kinda focused in on the fact that nothing was going to change if I kept doing the same thing...and why was I don't the same thing again? 

> So 2019's motto became "break it and remake it" 

> Actually it started out "[break it 'til you make it](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsGjZDiFZYf/)" but the new version is a bit more marketable, and put my fate in my own hands (and not luck's) 

> So I actually had something else to share with you that is only slightly related, but that gives a backdrop so let's just call that END SCENE ONE 

> SCENE TWO

> I came home today and was kinda mopey... not because anything's wrong but just because I'm here [in the new crib](https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/1103375649085915141) all alone (Fru comes on the 17th) and not really feeling energetic enough to go brave the nightlife, which is amplified due to [SXSW](https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/1104932754930704384)

> So I curled up on my loveseat and opened instagram and saw [this super cute post](https://www.instagram.com/p/But_EenI-rM/) by my brilliantly creative friend Ian and his kids  

> And then I saw another one of my friends, [James Buckhouse](https://jamesbuckhouse.com/), had commented on it and I didn't actually follow Buckhouse so I went to his account and saw that [his Sensorium event](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuZZXixHTef/) happened at the SF Opera the night I arrived in ATX 

> And then I got really mopey because I've attended all his prior events both as a supporter and to be creatively stimulated.

> See his design story of the idea [here](https://medium.com/design-story/total-design-f4d9f5537341) (scroll to the bottom to see [me and Fru with him](https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/575665500660756480) at the first event)

> But then as I kept scrolling through his instagram my mopey-ness melted and my awe began to rise: He's *doing* this. This isn't his day job; this is his joy. [He's *making it*](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkyiKSVlYZ2/)

> Now I'm inspired. END SCENE TWO 

> --FINAL SCENE--   

> I hop up from the couch, and move to the dining table to *make something.* not sure what, but it doesn't matter. If it's wrong, I'll break it and remake it. If it's good, I still might break and remake it just on principle. The making is the important part. 

> I need some music to go with this energy. Something creative. Something classical. I can't think of any modern composers so I open spotify with the intent to find an artist similar to Daniel Hope... but for some reason I remember him as Daniel Glass and search this name instead 

> Daniel Glass has no albums of his own and only appears on two other releases. That's because he's an unknown jazz drummer, not a world-renowned violinist 

> (Fun fact: at this time, spotify says you were listening to "Rock the Casbah") 

> One of the albums he appears on is called "[Imagine Your Heart's Journeys](https://open.spotify.com/album/4N4zfWiWRwdks2mYZcjTKl?si=KFTZlxuMTrmmyL6vTl01Bg)." It looks questionable. I hit play. 

> It jumps to life, and I roll with it. By the third song, I think I may have found this year's Space Kelly ðŸ˜‚  *[NOTE: there's an earlier text tome where I share the story of finding [this album](https://open.spotify.com/album/1NtdMK7WDHJZdJQi8PnelX?si=3WnYG7DtQK2NRvt9kIsRqQ) on Rdio (RIP) and how it, embarrassingly, never fails to improve my mood]*

> But by the end, I'm certain that this was the album I was to listen to. It's got like 26 monthly listeners, but it oozes with love for the music. It's someone else *[MAKING IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGzd5VR2z-U)* 

> What if we could shake off pretense and do what we love? Build what we've imagined?
