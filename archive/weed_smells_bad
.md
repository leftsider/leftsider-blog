BODY:
I've been pretty vocal throughout my illustrious time on earth about my views on drugs and alcohol. Anyone who knows me knows that I don't, never have, and that I most likely never will.

That being said, I've been around enough weed to mellow out all the bulls in Pamplona. Bowls, bongs and blunts to sacks, stems and seeds--I can smell almost instantly before it's even lit.

I say this because today, for the second time since I've been in Korea, I smelled weed. This would be common on a bus, at a club, or in certain areas of Maryland and DC. But in Korea, weed is a no-no. Yes, it's a no-no in the U.S., but here's it's like, for real.

Here telling someone you had a nickle bag would be like telling someone that your had four kilos of coke in your knapsack between the semi-automatic and the original copy of the anarchist's cookbook. People are serious about this here, man. It's no joke. So the smell of weed on a city street or a bus is ridiculously unlikely. So I have to come to the realization that someone just smells like a sweaty bag of dank.

Thinking about this is really strange, but smelling it makes it real. If someone smells like they just sampled the fire and they haven't even seen weed before, THEY FRIGGIN' STINK. There is no reason on God's green earth that you should smell so pungent and stinging. Sheesh. Take two baths.

I never before equated that smell with bad, but now I do. Weed stinks, and apparently so do two people living here.

Same here. I smelled it first time last year in the summer on our balcony, it came from down below, from my Landlord :P
My husband didn't wanna believe me, a few weeks later I told him to come out and smell and see, there it was ;)
I think they grow it somewhere in the mountains. Haven't found the place yet so.
Greetings, Nicole (today we go to Daegu - do some shopping on "great" Camp Walker ;)

Just because someone does Weed or other drugs, does not give you the right to say they"stink" or to judge or stereotype them, nor does it make the person any less than you or other "drug-free" human beings.  If you believe in God so much, I hope that you realize that we as humans are all equal regardless of what we do.  Its great that you dont do drugs and stay clean, and am nottrying to "egg you on" to taking in some THC.  But please, dont go around judging and stereotyping people who have a problem with drugs; they don't "stink", and like I said before, they are'nt any less human than you are.

*Check yo self.

I think you've misread my post. Read it again; I read it just now and I'm laughing  all over again.

I didn't say people who smoke weed stink; I said people who DON'T smoke weed but smell like they did....they stink.

So, just for clarification....I don't mind weed-smelling weedheads. I don't mind weedheads who smell normal. I don't mind the smell of weed. I dislike the smell of someone who has not smoked weed but smells like they did. Because they stink.

No person is less than me, I'm a pretty insignificant slug with a barely-read blog. Thanks for discovering it, btw. Hope you stick around and comment on some other posts. :)
