So I finally put some action behind my constant blabbing, and I've started making the map of Daegu that's so desparately needed. The ironic thing about this project is that if I had started this when I got here, I probably would have gotten some use out of it. As it stands, it'll probably be something to give to the expat/foreigner-friendly community as we make our exit. With our contract up in December, it seems like it's over all so soon.

Anyway, I'm thinking ahead with dread to the actual submit form and online application of the map and feeling knots in my stomach. Did I ever mention that I totally skipped out on the lessons about form submission when learning HTML? Backend has so not been my thing. I guess that's another thing to  conquer.

Actually, I'm thinking that maybe someone (Ed! ED! ED!!!!) might figure out a newer, sleeker method for interactivity (Cho! Are you listening????). That would actually give my map an edge over it's model, the <a href="http://www.superfuture.com">superfuture</a> maps.

And then, when they come to me asking how I did it I'll not reply to their emails in much the same way they didn't answer mine. *evil laugh*
