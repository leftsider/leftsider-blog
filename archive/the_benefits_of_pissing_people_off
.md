BODY:
I keep hearing this ideology around the blogosphere, and I keep agreeing with it, but man is it difficult to do. I have no trouble betting my income on my results; betting it against vindictive enemies is a different undertaking all together.

I imagine most people who practice this most effectively are those who work for themselves or as the head of what they do. Which comes first (the behavior or the position) I'll leave you to ponder.
