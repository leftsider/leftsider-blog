Beliefnet.com has an <a href="http://beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html">online quiz</a> do determine what religion most associates with your beliefs. I'm not sure what the dertermining factors are, but I decided to take it despite my skepticism. Here's my results:

1. Mainline to Conservative Christian/Protestant  (100%)
2. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons)  (94%)  
3. Mainline to Liberal Christian Protestants  (93%)  
4. Jehovah's Witness  (92%)  
5. Seventh Day Adventist  (84%)  
6. Bahá'í Faith  (77%)  
7. Orthodox Quaker  (76%)
8. Eastern Orthodox  (70%)
9. Roman Catholic  (70%)  
10. Orthodox Judaism  (68%)
11. Liberal Quakers  (63%) 
12. Sikhism  (59%)
13. Christian Science (Church of Christ, Scientist)  (58%)  
14. Unitarian Universalism  (56%)  
15. Islam  (55%) 
16. Reform Judaism  (50%)
17. Hinduism  (49%)  
18. Neo-Pagan  (46%) 
19. Jainism  (42%)  
20. New Age  (36%)  
21. Mahayana Buddhism  (33%)
22. New Thought  (32%)  
23. Secular Humanism  (32%)  
24. Theravada Buddhism  (32%)
25. Scientology  (28%)  
26. Nontheist  (24%)  
27. Taoism  (22%)  

I'm glad Adventism got up in the top five at least, but how did jehova's witness and mormonism get in there above it???
