Never went to the thing, but man did I have fun with the pictures. It really was where I went to think "fashion edge" before our trip to Korea. 

Actually, the real reason I even discovered the photos in the first place was because some site, long forgotten, linked to a series of the pics where a few people started going overboard with drunk guy jenga. Now that I think of it, was that <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/08/6222.html">from Kottke</a> as well?
