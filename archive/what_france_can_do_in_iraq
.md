<blockquote>We cannot ignore the crisis with the excuse that Iraq has fallen prey to a culture of violence. We cannot turn a deaf ear to the Iraqis because they were - over our objections - liberated and then controlled by our American and British allies. Iraq's troubles lie at the heart of the world's problems - the hostility between communities, religious fanaticism and conflicts of civilization that are being played out against a backdrop of terrorism, nuclear proliferation and globalization.</blockquote>
