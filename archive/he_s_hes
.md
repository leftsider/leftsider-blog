Whenever I go to Seoul I hit up the Cyberria near Hoegi Station. It was my first <a href="http://english.tour2korea.com/03Sightseeing/TravelSpot/travelspot_read.asp?oid=811&konum=subm1_1&kosm=m3_6">PC방</a> in Korea, and it's currently still <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/3016371/">my favorite</a>. Whenever I go, I'm usually there enough that the staff has a good time trying a few english words on me, helps me with some korean tech isues, and mercilessly watches me wonder how to play all of the fantastic games that everyone else is playing around me.

This time it was like my second home, and a lot less lonely. The guest housing I was provided with was a small spartan room in a quite large 4-bedroom bi-level apartment with no other guests, no tv or radio. So naturally, I probably spent more time at Cyberria than normal. 

This time, though, I gathered enough courage to pester the staff slightly more than usual, which they seemed to rather enjoy. At first, I wanted to try and get a login ID for a korean gaming site. One of the guys stopped when he saw me struggling through the hangul and helped me fill out the registration. Unfortunately, you have to put your civilian number in (is this like a SSN? Because I find this unbelievable that they would need this so i can play online go-kart racing....) and the number on my alien registration card wasn't accepted. Man, I knew Koreans looked out for their own, but this is ridiculous!

After that, they gave me a little more license. I was able to do a little more, like a regular would, and they'd come around periodically to see if I was ok. Last night, a girl helped me with yet another attempt at making an ID for a game--this time one that I found on the PC's desktop. I asked her what I needed to put in a certain textbox and within a few clicks she had me up an running. 

That's right folks, for the first time I've actually played a Korean online game. It was way cheesy but, ultimately, fun. The game (whose name I have forgotten) involves picking a chibi-styled character to drop water balloons. The impending splash breaks nearby blocks, which sometimes reveals special items. While you're doing this, the computer (or other online players) are doing the same thing, clearing the board to face you armed with item-enhanced balloons. First one hit, loses. 

I was initially disappointed with the simple mission, but ultimately was sucked in to the online play and the cuteness of the thing. I ended up wasting an hour or two on it. Plus, I was so happy to have an actual game going I didn't want to close it. =o]

I think there's a <a href="http://www.cyberria.com">Cyberria</a> near here in Siji; maybe I'll have to make a trip and see if they're as cool.
