BODY:
In Asian culture (particularly "monsoon Asia" which I'm <a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Asia-5th-Rhoads-Murphey/dp/032134054X">studying this semester</a>) there is a consistent foundation of dedication to the unit--familial, social, corporate and governmental--and its success, even at the sacrifice of personal gain. Individualism and freedom in the modern Western sense has traditionally been viewed as antisocial, selfish, and irresponsible; Everyone doing their own thing leads to chaos, where everyone pitching in for a common goal brings strength and solidarity.

Adding to this, a community-based philosophy does not seek direction from self-discovery. It instead looks to an elite or superior set of community members to set the standard for living and adherence. These people are leaders of the community and are looked to for guidance. Their status gives power but also responsibility to maintain an appearance of the ideal, to be reciprocated througout the organization. If there's a problem with the way everyone is working, theoretically it  should be traced back to the top.

Those who err face the guilt of disrespecting and sullying the unit as a whole, as all are equally involved and equally responsible for the actions of their counterparts. A sense of shame keeps these types of things to such a minimum that they are often seem blown way out of proportion when they do occur. The associations found in these systems are so tightly woven that those who abandon the unit (or <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2005/03/theres_no_i_in_foreigner.htm">were never a part to begin with</a>) will find it incredibly <a href="http://seoulover.blogs.com/westlaw/2006/09/affiliations.html">difficult to synchronize</a>.

So why am I talking about all this? Because I couldn't help but think, as I studied this, how applicable this is to social networks. SNs do not work through individuality, but rather through tightly woven (though sometimes loosely linked) associations. <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/09/digg_and_netscape_to_pay.htm">Certain people</a> maintain the status quo that is handed out to the masses. When individuals <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/09/societal_meshinga_bad_thing.htm">break formation</a>, an uproar ensues, often bringing guilt and/or shame. And, finally, not being a part of the community can be quite ostracizing.

Perhaps this cultural tendency allows <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/creative_commons/">some people</a> a quicker proclivity to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">projects that draw near to these models</a>. Perhaps, this is why I may be taking my foot out of my mouth with this post as I realize that, yes, these people have been talking progressively....I've just <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/08/joi_itos_web_continuous_partia.htm">been a little slow</a>. -_-;;

What do you think?
