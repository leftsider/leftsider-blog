Newly introduced to this blog. It's very well written, but I'm not really supportive of the department store philosophy--however it manifests itself. 

I started shopping the more boutique-styled stores because you could follow a brand or style that you love (essentially <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2006/12/post_161.html">filtering your clothing options</a>), paying, arguably, more for <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2006/09/stop_being_cheap_and_go_buy_so.html">what you value</a>. When Banana Republic got over their Safari outfit style (basically when they were bought out by Gap) I was a walking advertisement. Later I added even trendier lines like French Connection and Club Monaco. 

I stopped being a BR posterboy when everyone else looked like a BR posterperson. What was the point? Increasingly I realized that the entire setup was to give style to those who inherently didn't have it (like me) instead of encouraging people to make their own style. This is why it is so simple to run into a BR/JCrew/Gap and come out with an outfit--they make everything as compatible as possible so that you can have a good look without actually trying. 

Vintage was the next logical step. I'm horrible at shopping for vintage and for good reason. Cheaper, less focused stores like H&M allow me to cover my vintage faux pas with a retro uncoordinated coordination. This is essentially spending money to look like a cross between a <a href="http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/2006/11/on-streetperfect-part-2-manhattan.html">hobo</a> and a graphic design student (see <a href="http://www.hel-looks.com/">here</a> for a stereotypical association!).

I love this new style because it allows a conglomeration of new, old, mainstream and eclectic into a statement that defines you at the precise moment that you chose it! Just when fashion was about to truly become a networking vehicle (for fabric?)....here come the big guys again, scooping up whats hot from any brand and telling you how to achieve the disheveled look du jour. While I agree that it is the path that they needed to take to survive, did they really need to survive? I find it akin to a major television network scouring youtube, metacafe, etc., to offer you programming. While it might allow them to give more of what you want, isn't there an unnecessary step there? 

Where does convenience begin to beget conformity? Can this conformity vehicle be beneficial (changing the stagnation of boutique stores, etc)? How many times can one person say "meaning management" in one post? 

All very intriguing questions.
