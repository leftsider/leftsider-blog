If you've looked through the <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=daegu&w=32583357%40N00">pictures we took</a> while we were <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=daegu&w=51035603349%40N01">in Daegu</a>, you'll have a slight understanding of how shocked I was to see these pictures of just 50 years ago. The speed of development in Northeast Asia after the world war is simply staggering. People who lived in those pictures are very much still alive today--something that would be unfathomable in the states. Just wow.
