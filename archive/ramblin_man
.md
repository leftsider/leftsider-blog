	You may be saying to yourself, "Man, I thought this was going to be a peaceful and relaxing trip... looks like they never stop!" You would be thinking the exact same thing I was thinking.<br />
<br />
My general routine for my Costa Rica trips is as such: Fly in, Spend two days at my auntie's house bumming food and watching american movies with spanish subtitles to refresh my language, riding to Limon and vegging out at the beaches, go back one day before my flight leaves to see my great-grandma, fly home. Lots of meals with family and hanging out all through there.<br />
<br />
This time though I had to keep people <em> entertained</em>. I was a host and so I was rapidly getting cranky because I hadn't found my relaxation yet. When Ramiro asked if we would be interested in touring Bocas del Toro, Panama, with a group he was taking down, I was torn as it would further prevent me from enjoying my usual hideaways. But, it was another stamp on the passport and a ridiculously low price; we took the offer and were soon walking (yes, walking) across this bridge to Changuinola, Panama.
