February's blues put me so far behind; much of March was spent bemoaning the situation. But as this month draws to a close, I'm happy to say that I've really pushed myself to new limits and have largely accomplished a lot of what I'd left undone. 

As a result, I'll reap the benefits. Tomorrow morning I head to New York City, where I'll shoot some stand-ups for a show that I'll be hosting live <a href="http://hopetv.org/article.php?id=4">Thursday at 7pm</a>. The show is called "Let's Talk New York City," and is one of a series that places younger Adventists in an unedited, unscripted discussion with the president of the Adventist world church. 

It's a part of a larger plan to connect with the youth of the church, as a majority of the church body is now under the age of 35. There's also <a href="http://letstalk.adventist.org/">a website</a> that allows those who were not fortunate enough to sit in a session to voice their concerns, questions, and criticisms. I'd love to be a part of the discussion, but unfortunately my job is to facilitate.

Friday morning Fru and I are off to holiday in Costa Rica. No, no particular eco-tour in our itinerary; rather, we're going to visit my family and celebrate my birthday (3rd April) as well as my feisty great-grandmother's (7th). It so happens that the week is also "Semana Santa," holy week, so we'll enjoy the country-wide festivities and time off. 

I've got other travel lined up, and I'm pretty excited. End of June I'll be attending <a href="http://gien.adventist.org/forum2007/index.html">GIEN</a> at  Newbold College in Berkshire, with a possibility of presenting on social networks. You have no idea how happy that makes me; if the travel wasn't enough, being able to present something that fascinates me to others at a convention makes all the <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/publications">vicarious living</a> I've been imagining seem so much more real. I'm happy to start from here, wherever that may be, and work my way up. I only wish I was as adept as these <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/speaking/index.shtml">veterans</a> at juggling the costs and <a href="http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?joi_s_travel">keeping the flow of engagements coming</a>. 

Late July I've been asked to be a speaker for one of the events in a mission initiative in Bacolod, Philippines. I'm a little apprehensive about this one because I don't have a real feel on who my audience will be. I like to scope out the mindset before presenting, just because my whole passion is built upon communicating in a way that is native to the thought processes of the recipient. l guess I'll have to do some quick assessing once I'm on the ground there.

Finally, I'm seeing if I can manage a way to get Fru and I to the second <a href="http://www.wcycs.org/main/main.asp">World Conference on Youth and Community Service</a>, a quinquennial event that will be happening in Taiwan around Christmas. I miss Asia something fierce and would love to check in and check out Taiwan. I know this is a ridiculous amount of travel for the average earthling, and that those who I admire are practically otherworldly in this respect. But I feel that if I can push myself to accomplish the ordinary and mundane tasks, I should reward myself by pushing to accomplish the extraordinary and novel things I'd so much rather be doing.
