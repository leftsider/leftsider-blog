Our motivation to make computer games the way that we do, stems from the fact that we enjoy certain aspects of commercial computer games a lot, but dislike others with a passion. So we try to make computer games without all the things that we don't like (competition, meaningless violence, strict rules, predefined goals, canned stories). We also try to add a certain level of authorship that we feel is lacking in commercial games. They often feel too much like products that fell off an assembly line in some toy factory than deepfelt expressions of creative people.

The Endless Forest in particular was motivated by a desire to create a peaceful social environment. Online games very often seem like dressed up single player games. We try to design interactions that invite playing with each other. We also consciously removed all ways in which players could hurt or annoy each other. That's why there is no chat in the game, for instance.
