BODY:
At the strong recommendation of <a href="http://www.kangmi.org/index/weblog/comments/oh_and_for_the_record/">Kangmi</a> and the referral of <a href="http://eflgeek.com/">EFLGeek</a> (I hope; let me know if that didn't go through), I've moved Leftsider over to <a href="http://www.site5.com/">Site5</a>. 

While <a href="http://www.fatcow.com/fatcow/index.bml">Fatcow</a> was not a bad host; I found the service to be par at best and the plans severely lacking. Every so often they're giving a way prizes for referral, but I saw very little going to improving service itself. Since opening an account with Site5 a little over a week ago, I've already received notification of <em>two</em> significant upgrades to areas of the service that already were equal or ahead of Fatcow. I also was extremely impressed that all user portals and management systems were created by Site5 specifically for Site5, with the engineers having their own blog to show progression of various projects.

Sofar the transition has been quick and relatively painless; I noticed that the prices advertised for domain processes were advantageous enough that I also gave the pinkslip to my longtime domain manager, <a href="http://www.gandi.net/">Gandi</a>, as well. This one I'm actually kinda sad about; Gandi was low-key, no-frills, but surprisingly responsive and never troublesome. I would still recommend them as the 12euro price is still not unreasonable.

Anyway, we're just waiting on the domain transfer now. Hope you'll also notice the slight improvement in the site's receptiveness as a result of the switch. Let me know if you find any problems anywhere, as I went the lazy route and just modified CSS rather than importing the old design. Thanks for you patience during the pause.

Hope you like Site5. I'm still very happy with them. 

Curiuosly, I used to be with Gandi, too, but I found their interface hard to follow (since I didn't know what I was doing, that made it even harder).

Uncanny!
They recently redesigned their site--a DRASTIC improvement. But yeah, it was definitely no-frills. If you mastered it, you deserved a medal. ^^

I can't say I ever mastered it, but at some point the clunkiness outweighed the price, so I moved on to my current registrar.
