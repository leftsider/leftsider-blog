<blockquote>The Washington Post has a brief article called "Why Everyone You Know Thinks The Same As You". In short, you hang out with people who are like you, a phenomenon known as homophily. This happens online, and indeed the Internet can lower the costs of finding people like you. But homophily raises the question for social software designers of how much they should encourage homophily and how much they want to mix it up.</blockquote>

Good topic, but an unfortunately flat post. What are the benefits and dangers of homophily in social networks?

A recent biology professor related a story about cheetahs that I often use to flesh out this point. Skipping the fascinating way in which it was discovered, basically scientists have discovered that all cheethas living today have an identical genetic makeup. At some point, their numbers were reduced almost extinction, and their gene pool, as a result, was severely reduced. With only a few cheetahs left to mate, and then the subsequent inbreeding that occured, it basically ensured that these cats would have very little difference.

The consequence of this, however, is that any virus or bacteria that is lethal to one cat will be lethal to all. <strong>There is no survival of the fittest in the extreme case of homophily; all share the same strengths--and the same vulnerabilities.</strong>

What the article refers to as serendipity (I'm not averse to that titling, but I tend to think that the benefits may be acquired <em>without</em> realization) does make it a more arduous task to <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/05/a_couple_weeks_ago_i_1.htm">retain our identity</a>, but with that diversity we receive a more robust foundation for strength and growth. The same biology professor humorously noted that mutts tend to be the most resilient dogs--and this may, among other things, be a result of their genetic breadth.

How can we improve our serendipity online? What happens to our perspective when we <a href="http://theassimilatednegro.blogspot.com/">pick one topic and cater exclusively to that audience</a>? Or when we collect a variety of ideas under one common cause? How often do we really try to think, let alone use the web, in a way that is <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2006/10/connecting_the.html">other than who we are</a>? Can a social network connect like-minded individuals while still providing the spice of life that variety contains?
