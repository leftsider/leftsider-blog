BODY:
Just now, and with little deliberation, I've decided to heretofore refer to my usual processes of trying new applications, mastering web techniques, learning new computer-related languages, dabbling in basic scripting and programming, figuring out computer software or hardware-related issues, web browsing and blogging as "scratching my nuts."

That was something I used to do quite often as a adolecent and high school student. It was an almost involuntary condition that happened on a constant basis--from when i first got up until I got back into bed. Sometimes it produed a pleasant satisfaction, while other times it had no effect at all. And, finally, people always gave me funny looks when i talked about it. 

Yeah. it's really quite similar. Any objections are welcome in the comments section.
