Currently in Seoul....alone and in my favorite PCbaang.

I got a call last week from someone kvetching about the horrible job a drifting freelance web guy did in creating a website for an organization. Long story short, I'm waiting now to buy a ticket to Bangkok and fix the problem in person. That's right, I got a freelance job in Thailand.

I should be there no more than a week. And hopefully the laptop will have a nice little connection to plug into so there'll be no shortage on posts. Fru's kinda bummed since this is the first time I'll be away from her for this long since we've been married--she always gets like this the first time I do something, but she'll be fine.

Anyway, be checking <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/">Flickr</a> for pics of Bangkok in the next few days.
