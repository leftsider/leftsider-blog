<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	Christmas dinner was a onslaught of "firsts." First Christmas in hot weather, First Christmas in a country where Christianity is not the majority (so ALL stores were open! Sweet!), First time having pizza for the time-honored meal.....but all of the above were so good. <br />
<br />
Fru and I walked the strip and then made one of our favorite pizza joints, California Pizza Kitchen, our Christmas Dinner Finalist. Delicious.
