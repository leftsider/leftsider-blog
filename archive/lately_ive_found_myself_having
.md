Lately I've found myself having a small knot of anxiety, coming from one of the strangest of ideas. With our impending departure from Korea imminent, I find myself unexpectedly nervous about not seeing korean. Right now I'm looking out the window of an office in Busan, and on the signs, the advertisments, the businesses and apartments there is one concurrent theme: <em>hangul</em>.

It's become a bit of a habit to look at storefront signs and billboards-- even commercial vehicles--to see if I can decipher what it says; is there Konglish? is there a new vocabulary word hidden in the content? So many insights and amusements can be found by just looking around Korea. And I feel that those things, without exception, won't be there for me in the US. And that makes me a little sad.

Just another reason why I'm just not ready to go.
