I'm not surprise, they did the same for Dragon ballZ and look how great that movie turn out. even Dustin Hoffman played a native american.soon theres going to be white actors playing with black paint on they faces or sxxt they already do in Tropical Thunder but the S**t was funny. 
Bienvenidos a' America B.

Hahahahahaha bonus points for referencing the Dragonball movie. America needs to stop making movies where:

1. The non-white character is played by a white man (Avatar: The Last Airbender)
2. The white man discovers the beauty of a culture and leads them to victory (Avatar)

See a trend here? :P
