BODY:
Recently been thinking about how little of my life is according to plan. You can think of that in two ways. 

If I were to say that my life doesn't always go according to plan, most would share that feeling. And it is true that little of my life has turned out the way I expected it to--to the extent that it's not uncommon to hear me on a soapbox suggesting that nothing that is realized ever matches the picture you had of it in your head. We betray ourselves by leaning too heavily on projections we derive and expecting the world to conform. My life has not turned out how I planned but it is still a very good life--arguably better than what I could have imagined. 

Which leads to the second way of thinking about this. I have a life that is unimaginable for many--if not most. This is not a boast but a fact--one that I try to remind myself of each day. An early influencer recently admonished me, "...[N]ever forget that this is an honor. Not something you've earned or is owed to you... [T]reat each day as a privilege." So I am acutely aware that for me to say that I don't wake up to an alarm clock or have any specific time to wake up, I don't have a point in time where I'm "early", "late" or "on time" as far as being in the office, I largely can choose to work remotely at my whim, and I am the primary actor in defining my job and career path is a truly rare position that I'm truly fortunate to have. It makes me want to do the most with it and to not squander what so many dream of achieving.

So I worry that the lack of imposed structure results in the lack of structure overall. If someone isn't planning my life and how it should be lived, the responsibility lies with me. If I don't have a plan, and don't build structure so that my efforts, energies and resources are going to a specific thing (or set of things), all of the privilege and opportunity I'm afforded is lost. Perhaps I need to reassess and find something worth planning my living around.
