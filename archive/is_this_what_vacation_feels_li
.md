BODY:
Taking some time off has been really interesting. In a sense, I feel relief from the pressures of work and school (and web, honestly). On the other hand, I've felt as if I've not been making any gains--personal progress--as well. As such, my vacation has felt a lot like the break you get when you take the elevator instead of the stairs (you do take the stairs, don't you?).

I've managed to whittle down my RSS feeds to a point where I'm two weeks behind now. I intended to tackle this while on holiday in <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/106688">Chicago</a>, but internet access....well, you can ask your brother-in-law for the password for his wireless network, but I dare say you're overstepping your boundaries when you ask permission to reset his router since the password is obviously incorrect. I'd suggest doing something else like...reading my next post. :)
