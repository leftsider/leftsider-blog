<blockquote>I find myself wishing more and more that we could teach people the ability to see the world through other perspectives. I think we can detest someone's hypocrisy and regret his awful decisions, and maybe even resent his beliefs, while still being sympathetic for his having been in a situation that left him with no good choices.</blockquote>

Perspective and compassion are important tools for greater understanding. Yes, I'm sounding a little Dalai Lama right here, but if it's true there's not much I can do about that. :)
