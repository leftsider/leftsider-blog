BODY:
I'm happy that my metropolitan area made second place in the level of well-bing US cities (cited in the article), but it is more interesting to see the correlation between specific things and feelings of well-being. For a measure of clarity (especially for those unaccustomed to looking at charts of this type) it would have been nice to see a few areas that were considered (or discovered) to be non-essential to metropolitan well being. 

All together [very interesting](http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/richard_florida/2010/02/more_on_happiness.php).
