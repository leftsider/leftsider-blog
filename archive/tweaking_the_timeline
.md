BODY:
Twitter has fundamentally changed the way I live. When I started using it five years ago, my first interest was finding the location of the coworkers I played ping pong with when I felt like playing a game *(Fun fact: Every one of those people stopped using the service within a week, with only [@smellvin](http://twitter.com/smellvin) returning)*.

I met other people and used it sorta like a chat room. I applied for a chance to write for [eHub](http://emilychang.com/ehub/), which was not paid but opened the way for some [real work](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/readwriteweb_new_design.php). Somehow I managed to use Twitter to get paid! Amazing!

Fast forward three years and now I'm *actually getting paid by Twitter.* All the years of heavy usage and advocacy paid off, it seems. But if I'm completely honest, I'll have to admit that I've [struggled with its growth]() and have tried [numerous times]()--all unsuccessfully--to use it in a way that works for me perfectly. I've never been able to do that.

Today I got rid of the lists I'd previously created, and now I'm looking for a new solution. How can I hear new and interesting things while filtering out unnecessary noise? How can I participate in select conversations while effectively ignoring others. Can I still serve my OCD-like tendency to read every tweet when I've doubled the people I follow, or will I have to learn some new way to find what's of interest to me?

I'll have to report back with any solutions I find.
