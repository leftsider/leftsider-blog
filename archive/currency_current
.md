This morning, while looking for my card reader, I rummaged through two of my bags and found coinage from six countries (U.S. included). It's incredible to think that I've done that type of travelling in the last two years; it's nothing extensive, but it is far more international travel than I could have imagined for myself ten years ago.

Still, looking at those coins did not make me feel accomplished. On the contrary, I felt that just as they indicated money I did not spend, there were encounters and experiences in these countries that I had not tasted yet. It also made me look forward, wondering when I'd next be able to spend this loose change--or when I'd be able to add another denomination to the set.

When does a person feel that they have seen/experienced enough? I once lived with an old lady who had spent her entire life (save one trip to Florida) in a 90-mile radius. She was completely happy with her experiences and had no want for new horizons. I, on the other hand, have already visited about a dozen countries and I've still <a href="http://www.43places.com/person/leftsider">a list of places I still want to see</a>! Any ideas for a remedy for wanderlust?
