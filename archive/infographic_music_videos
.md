It is indeed a neat little video, but I thought mildy contrived. I definitely echoed the video's commenters in that it immediately put me in mind of the Royksopp video I had seen years before. While the Longcut video does tell a more specific story, the Royksopp one stays truer to the term infographics (and I personally think is more catchy). 

Who says information graphics can't be fun?
