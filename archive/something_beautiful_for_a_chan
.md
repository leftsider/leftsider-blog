A beautiful collection of amazing art worth noting, especailly since in comes from one of the most beautiful places that I've ever been that you never hear beautiful things about. 

I'm feeling a wave of creativity and ingenuity cresting, so I'm absorbing all the beautifully unique thinking that I can these days. This one is thanks to <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">Fru</a>. Be nice to her; she's a new blogger. heh.
