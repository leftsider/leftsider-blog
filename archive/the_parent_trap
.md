Your somewhat-humble author is blessed in many ways, and doesn't often use this medium to speak to the ways in which his life is great. I try to avoid using this blog as a platform for whining and moaning, but I haven't been nearly as intentional about speaking to the bright side. 

Today my intention was to share the tensions that exist in the relationship that I have with my parents, but it must first be said that I have parents--parents who I love. My parents aren't perfect, and they have their issues, but they have been nothing but supportive to me and have been great parents to my sister and I. The tension that I have with my parents is less about them and more about me; less about the parenting they provided and more about my projections and expectations around who they should be for me now in adulthood. 

My parents are divorced and remarried. They've re-partnered with nice people who are a) nice to them and b) are comfortable with my sister and I and open to being a part of our family. This is huge, apparently. The fact that my father can joke with my mother's husband and that my mom can chat amicably with my dad's wife is something that I may have taken for granted as a holiday gathering norm. It wasn't always that way, but I am so proud of the path my family has chosen to take in this regard. 

My sister and I sometimes express mildly exasperated resignation when speaking to each other about our parents. We're adults now, and that always changes the things you looked at when you were children. When you are the same age as the schoolteacher you start to realize with more accuracy what your teacher's life might have been when you viewed them as a font of wisdom. When you are older than your doctor or therapist, you might find yourself wondering whether their context is as comprehensive as you need it to be. And when you're all grown up (and in my little sister's case, a parent) you look with rose-colored glasses at the greatness of your parents past efforts, casting a deep shadow over who they are now.

To this end, I think it would only be fair to revise my thinking about my parents. They were my parents, so I guess I want them to be parents to me still. To have more insight than me, to provide counsel and guidance; to have an opinion about who I am and what I am potentially becoming. The reality is that perhaps that phase of my relationship with my parents may be yielding to a new phase where--I don't know--they're more like friends or old people who I've known my whole life. 

But regardless of how awkward the current transition is, despite the frustration that might arise in our interactions, and even though they stress me out at times (most times, honestly), my life is great in large part because of them, and I am thankful for each moment I have with them.
