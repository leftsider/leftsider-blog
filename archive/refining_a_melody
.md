BODY:
Among the many excuses I've spouted for not writing, the most nearly removed is a need to transition from [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.com) to an open-source variant, [Open Melody](http://www.openmelody.org). 

There are a number of reasons why I made the switch. First. MT's parent company, Six Apart, is no longer extant. Next, While I've threatened for years to write an entry about there not being one competent, consistent and available MT developer in existance, I have enjoyed the discussions I've had with the developers of Open Melody, largely through work I've down with [Endevver](http://www.endevver.com). And finally, because I find the MT markup language elegant and useful enough to disuade me from learning anything else (a stab at working in Wordpress for a recent project had me wanting to stab my eyes out).

There are certainly some issues I'm encountering during the transition, but my intent is to apply daily attention to this task so that, little by little, the job is done.  I'm already fully migrated and now just tweaking design and effects.

One thing I am considering is the removal of comments. I'm wondering if commenting is dead and perhaps integration with Facebook, Twitter and Google+ would better serve conversation. We'll see where that leads.
