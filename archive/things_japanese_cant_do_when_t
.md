<blockquote>goo Rankings published another one of their silly yet slightly unsettling polls recently, when they looked at what things are impossible to do now that they are an adult. The original Japanese version is phrased to have a suggestion of regret, I feel. The survey was conducted between the 18th and 20th of December last year.</blockquote>

This is one of those quirky blogs where you can't imagine why someone would make it....but it's just so darn interesting. My specific interest in this piece is that, while it is relatively low, Writing Kanji was listed in this top 20 list. Enter Leftsider, enrolled in Japanese II this semester--which focuses on Kanji learning. Hmm.
