BODY:
After reading that <a title="Leftsider: Webbed Interest Archives" href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/webbed_interest/index.htm#a000046">sleep debt article</a> a while back, I decided to try and increase the number of hours I sleep daily. I usually feel like I've been dragged over stones in the morning (especially since we got here in Daegu) so I figured maybe my sleep debt was catching up with me. 

Well it's been a little over a week, and boy what a week it's been. This crap sucks. I felt awful from the first day--like I was digging out of my grave every morning. Sometimes I literally asked Frulwinn to give me a hand to get up. Absolutely horrible.

But it's getting better. Today was the first day I woke up actually feeling nothing. I didn't wake up refreshed, but I didn't wake up groggy either; I just <em>got up</em>. Maybe it's like giving up cigarettes or caffeine, where you go through a withdrawal and then come out the other side clean and fresh. I hope so.

The only other downside is that I'm not used to spending so much time sleeping, especially late-night. I'm hoping this isn't my regression into senioritis. I'm not getting old, I'm just taking care of myself, got it???

You know, these people go even further.
They say that you should go to bed every day at the same time and get up at the same time too - yeiks ;)
Greetings from your neighbour from Waegwan, Camp Carroll - the world is small :)

Tell me about it! If it weren't for my wife's weird looks I might just sleep in the middle of the day. 
I just feel more inspired at night; apparently you're a wandering insomniac as well! =o]

Yep, take a nap during the day - bad idea - cause you can't sleep at night :-S
But I love nights too and days and mornings - slight problem there, cause I love to sleep too ;)
Ever told you that I'm weired? ;)
