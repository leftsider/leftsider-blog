<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	It's the way I feel right now. My mind is lost between a two-week whirlwind of taxis, boats and buses; airports, cities and countries. I've started the last two mornings stuck between my home and traveling routines. Mixing languages. Feeling confused.<br />
<br />
It's strange not feeling at home even when I am at home. It's a new experience that I've not felt in previous travels. I'm not sure why this trip was any different from any other. The time changes were not a significant factor this time out... perhaps I never mentally unpacked. Anyway, now I have a lot of stuff to sort through to get back on the level this week. Posting resumes, but lightly.<br />
<br />
I hope to show a few pictures as well... stay tuned.
