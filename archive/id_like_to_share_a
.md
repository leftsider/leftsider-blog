BODY:
I'd like to share a little of what I've been doing at work.

In 2008 I was hired to manage [adventist.org](http://www.adventist.org). It is the official website of the Seventh-day Adventist church, and I was excited to take on such a visible project. Three years later, the site looks largely the same as it did then, but I think this butterfly is about ready to break from its cocoon. 

I'll try to be honest without being whiny; while the world headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist church is a huge vehicle for change in the lives of millions of people around the world, it cruises along on many independently-controlled wheels. While corporate strategies are developed and implemented throughout its departments, it is done so in the manner that the departments decide. Especially when it comes to web, there is nothing outside of a few guidelines for the community at large [*](http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/web-site-guidelines.html) to act as policy for developing online presence. 

Instead of handling the sexy details of the job, I went straight to work behind the scenes. I established a content management platform for official Communication websites (yes, there was no CMS when I got here--my predecessor updated content via Dreamweaver or an editor of choice). This allowed the management of content to expand beyond my desk, involving PR and others who were responsible for creating content. Today, nearly a dozen individuals are handling content--that distributes across about 15 sites--via a single point of entry. We're no North Temple [*](http://northtemple.com/), but hey, maybe in a couple years... :)

I also started managing projects in a way more along the lines of iteration and goal-directed design that I found while reading Alan Cooper's seminal work [*](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2007/05/about_face_3_foreword.html). Concepts like site versioning, personas, contextual scenarios, ticketing and staging drove my colleagues crazy--they're communicators, not designers, after all. Over time things made sense and we could see progress behind us--as well as ahead of us.

The big hurdle, though, was fragmentation. Nearly every department already has it's own website and even its own logo; the power of an official website is nil when its content is siphoned off to other online destinations. We struggled long and hard to come up with a solution; without one, a redesign of our flagship site would be new wallpaper on empty, abandoned walls.

If you thought working under the hood was ugly, you've never had to deal with organizational politics.
