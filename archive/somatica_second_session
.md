BODY:
With another Somatica session under the belt, I have truly drunk the kool-aid. So much personal insight gained and program intention realized; I find myself either thinking or talking about it everyday. 

For me, halfway through the training program, Somatica presents two profound challenges: accepting yourself and being vulnerable as often as possible. 

Accepting yourself is deceptively complex. Listening to your body; recognizing that the critical voice in your head is a learned practice. Reviewing the experiences that shape your thinking and doing; resisting the urge to shame past actions and instead recognizing your capacity to thrive in adverse conditions without the benefit of hindsight. Seeing how your past makes you and not trying to correct anything; instead, recognizing both the good and the bad as who you are, loving who you are, and stepping forward into life with new strength and context. 

That is the type of arduous work that a) is lifelong and b) you won't want to keep hidden. So you practice that self-acceptance in your daily life, and in doing so develop empathy with others who are in varying stages of their own self-acceptance. First with your closest circle, then with your acquaintances, and then with the world at large--you present your authentic self: exposing your true feelings, stating your needs, establishing boundaries. Sharing all this with others so that they have an opportunity to learn how to love and work with the real you. Accepting not everyone will want to learn, and some may even dislike and oppose you; persisting in self-love and external empathy rather than shielding yourself from rejection--because that shield also restricts connection, emotion, growth and creativity.

During the second module, I shed tears over hurt I've harbored for years. Then, the next day, I shed tears of joy marveling at the brilliance of my lovely niece during a post-session visit. The following day I shed tears twice for the struggles of others in the training who shared vulnerably with me. And suddenly I was filled with emotion: love, acceptance, happiness even through pain, hope, peace, acceptance. 

Imagine the struggle to regulate all these feelings returning back to the office! I nearly cried explaining to my newest hire the hope I had for her and our team and the desire I had to help her be great at her job. But like all things, in time we settle back into our routines...I'm not emotionless yet but I'm feeling the feels at a much more stable level. I hope I can hold on to it and not let it fully recede.
