<blockquote>Children who were praised for their effort were more likely to choose a harder test when given a choice, were less likely to become disheartened when given a test they were guaranteed to fail, and when finally given the original tests again, their marks improved.

In contrast, the children praised for their intelligence tended to choose an easier test if asked, were distressed by failure, and actually had worse marks after re-taking the original tests.</blockquote>

Wow this is really interesting. I really wonder about this for personal reasons. I guess it would be difficult to determine whether this could be adjusted/reversed after childhood. Hmm.
