BODY:
Hosting the first night of the Adventist Mission presentations turned out to be relatively painless. When I get a copy of the event (hopefully this week) maybe I'll put up a clip so you can see me in all my hosting glory. heh.

I actually spent a portion of Friday running around looking for a jacket to wear on stage. I haven't worn suits in a while and the ones I had weren't really bringing my <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=a-game">A-game</a> to the table. So I blew a couple hundred on a jacket, but I think I picked something that I can utilize with my wardrobe in the future.

Lots of good things to talk about regarding this weekend (except the fact that I'm working Sunday) so I'll post more soon.
