BODY:
A while back, Blogger enhanced its commenting feature, allowing you a wider range of choices in allowing comments to your site. 

Before, you usually let anyone and everyone comment to your blog. This made you easy prey fro comment spammers, so they added the option to allow only Blogger users to comment to your site. Nice. Except I don't use blogger.

I used blogger in 2002. Then I did my own thing with greymatter. Now I've been quite happy with moveable type for quite some time. Anyway, I don't want to have to go back to my kindergarten days to say something about your post on toothpaste. Blogger realized that, and now you can select "blogger," "other," or "anonymous" when posting to a blog....

...IF THE BLOG HAS UPDATED ITS SETTINGS. So bloggerheads and blogspot users, I beseech thee--in the name of all that is holy please pay attention to Bloggers updates and change your settings. Keep up.
