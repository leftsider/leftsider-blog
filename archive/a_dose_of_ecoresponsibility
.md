Watching an outdated public service announcement this morning on MTV Korea, I started thinking about the environment. Yeah. I don't know what that was all about either.

As long as we are makin' babies, we're going to be using more and more natural resources and taking up more space, right? Is that the way it has to go--absorb and sprawl? Living here in Korea has me rethinking that. Maybe there's another way.

Ninety-nine percent of the people that I've met in Korea do not have a yard. I've met some poor people (who generally live off the land more), a few rich people (who tend to have more expansive living habits), and a whole bunch of people in the middle. Only one couple out of all of them have land for actual landscaping, and they're dreadfully embarrased about it (I haven't actually seen it). 

It makes sense. In a country that is around 70% mountainous, inhabitable space is at a premium. Having large unused areas of land insinuates a kind of decadence (an insinuation that is untrue in that couple's case). You don't have land and not use it; it's not efficient or economical. Rather than spreading out, the housing schemes mimic the mountains themselves--going up instead of out. Is this something that we can develop on a global scale?

I'm just thinking briefly here; would it be feasible to start redesigning our cities to accomodate larger amounts of people in smaller spaces? From the living room window, I can see the homes of easily 5,000 people, with additional accomodations for at least half that in construction. 

Some of these apartments aren't that great, but some of them are absolutely fantastic. The new ones are top scale and easily surpass half-million dollar investments. At the base of the mammoth units are restuarants, services, educational institutes, grocers, and small shopping centers. People move in and out using freight elevators or trucks that have an lift-like ladder to unload furniture and items through the balcony window.

It's really nice when you become accustomed to it. It'll be hard for me to go back to the dream of a house and a backyard for a daily life option. I'd rather free up land for beautification of our world, for farmland, for wildlife protection. I feel like a homeland hippie now; I think I'm going to take a shower.
