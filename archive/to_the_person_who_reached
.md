To the person who reached this site looking for skate parks in Daegu: There are none. But there is a ramp in front of the ceremonial bell at <a href="http://thedaeguguide.com//places/placesmain.htm#Gukchaebosang">Gukchaebosang Park</a>. Otherwise, be content to rollerblade in a circle at world cup stadium and various spots around the city.

To the person who reached this site looking for obese koreans: There are none. That's it. But if you stay long enough, you'll find people  that you think are grotesquely overweight; then you'll come back the the US and remember that, like Leftsider told you, there are no obese koreans.

My thinking on this subject is paralell to yours Lefty. I just have a question though. Was the Adam and Eve situation in the garden of Eden an example of this phrase in opposites? Meaning were they good only because they had no knowledge of good and evil? And when they did aquire that knowledge(ate the forbiden fruit) of good and evil at what point did their increasing knowledge steer them towards good again?
