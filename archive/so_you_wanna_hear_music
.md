So you wanna hear music? Glad you asked.

You know I've felt bad that <a href="http://mykoreapop.blogspot.com">my podcast show</a> has been silent for over a month now, but my external hard drive with all my content was left in Korea and is just now being shipped (hopefully) carefully (hopefully!!!) back to me here. So even I've been struggling with a lack of tunes to live life to.

Well, until the next podcast, feel free to listen to guys so much better than I. Although it's not Korean, my all-time most lovable DJ, Mr. Scruff, has a online radio show I just discovered that you might find interesting. it's called <a title="hot pot radio : mr scruff vs. treva whateva : archive" href="http://www.hotpotradio.com/archive.asp">hot pot radio</a>--have a listen. 

If it's a little too wacky for you, there's a much wider range of stuff available from <a href="http://milkaudio.com/web/livemix_archive.php">milkaudio's archive</a>, spanning back to way back when....2000!

Ok, enjoy...and don't get spoiled and stop looking for the podcast.
