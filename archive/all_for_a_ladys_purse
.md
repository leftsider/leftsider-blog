Saw this a while back: People in Wenzhou, China get **straight gangsta** on some would-be thieves... and it gets caught on camera. 

There's so much awesome in this scene to me. First, look at the street at the beginning of the clip. Now look at the street towards the end; all those people for a lady's purse? Then look at how many people get *actively* involved... for a lady's purse. It makes me angry all over again that [something far worse](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/nyregion/26homeless.html) could happen while we all watch... but I've [talked about that at length](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/02/protest-in-the-age-of-detached.html) already.
