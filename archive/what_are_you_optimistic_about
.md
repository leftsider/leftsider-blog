I think Joi has a great answer here. It exudes hope, reinforces his optimistic nature and, most importantly to me, tells where he sees things going. Let's be honest; the only reason I'm a fanboy of Mr. Ito is because I think he has a good view of what tomorrow can be. So a post like this is pure gold to me.

The post also links to others' answers. See also <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/01/what-are-you-optimistic-about">Kottke's</a> would be answer; compare and contrast on your own.

How about you? what are you optimistic about?
