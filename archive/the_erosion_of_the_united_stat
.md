Met my friend <a title="A couple weeks ago I (Leftsider)" href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/05/a_couple_weeks_ago_i_1.htm">Rachel</a> on the bus and we somehow got into a very one-sided conversation.

"I think the foreigners are destroying this country," she spouted angrily, completely aware of the irony in the fact that she, herself, was a foreign resident. She complained that as the foreign population largely works in the service industry, customer relations and care were suffering considerably. 

I countered that I felt more affinity to foreigners after returnting from Korea. I looked at the ample resources and opportunities available in America, and noted that very few Americans took advantage of it; no where near the amount of foreigners that seek out success. To me, Americans are to blame for allowing foreigners to usurp our spoils. 

"But they bring the third world here," she argued. "Especially if you are a foreigner....you wouldn't believe me if I told you that service people said to me 'You're from Africa; why are you compaining about this service?' That is terrible."

Perhaps she is right. We both came to agree that no matter what side you approach it from the U.S. will not be a power above others for long. Other countries will rise and catch the stagnant power and even our global plane. She calls this degradation; I call it globalization.

What do you call it? Is it a good thing, either for America or for the world? Is is something you look forward to, or something you think needs correcting?
