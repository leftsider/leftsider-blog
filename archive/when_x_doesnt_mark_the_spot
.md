How'd I miss this one?

I've always feared that my intentions of always looking for the next best thing made me an anti-hipster hipster. Hugh at gapingvoid re-encourages me to not tolerate the hype.

Yes, I am posting right now from an iBook. I don't hate Apple; I just prefer windows. In fact, I only purchased this notebook after knowing I could install XP on it (yes, I run windows on my iBook) I now do tech support for my wife's powerbook as well as for my family's windows machines at home.

OS X is probably the best operating system I've used. However using X involves an almost philosophical change in how you think and do things; something that is counter-intuitive and inefficient for me. I've become much more proficient on a Mac over the last 9 months,  but isn't progress--that's recooperation.

When I get back home, I'll retrive my trusty PC (or build another) and definitely transition back.

Have you gone mad?  Or is it just all the tech support grief that's got you down?
