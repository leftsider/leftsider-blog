I think Leftsider has become dormant enough that I can _reset_, taking it back to the old days when it was less formal and more for the moment.

Although it has been quiet, I have been writing. [Medium](https://twitter.com/medium), a new publishing platform from the founder of Blogger (and Twitter!) has been fun to try out. While I ultimately miss the linear connectivity that Leftsider provides, I find good traction for ideas there. I [expressed my concern](https://medium.com/how-to-use-the-internet/581f842279ff) about social networks, [shared a painful reality](https://medium.com/changing-city/e03d9b7481e) of San Francisco living, and [pointed out a few things](https://medium.com/better-humans/62c577f4a06) that others seem to really relate to (over four thousand views!).

If you are here as a faithful feed subscriber or a occasional surfer, I hope you'll find those externally-posted pieces worth your while.
