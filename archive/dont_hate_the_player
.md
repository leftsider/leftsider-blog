<a title="Relax, Bill Gates; It's Google's Turn as the Villain - New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/technology/24valley.html?ei=5094&en=e92eec83a68ff448&hp=&ex=1124942400&partner=homepage&pagewanted=all">Relax, Bill Gates; It's Google's Turn as the Villain - New York Times</a>

Silicon Valley's hating; what's new? 

Bill Gates is everyone's role model but Microsoft is the company that everyone loves to trash. Now Google looks like the new contender to the top spot, and all of a sudden the natives are restless again. Google's better than Microsoft ever was, or Google's more evil than Microsoft ever was--which is it?

There's a guy in Greek mythology named Sisyphus who really isn't relevant to this topic. However, he was banished by the gods to the underworld where his punishment was to push a heavy boulder up a steep hill. Upon completion, the boulder would, by its own weight, roll back down to the bottom. Rinse and Repeat.

This fate has often been used as a reference to futile and endless tasks we take on. And rather then a punishment for a wily man, it's viewed one man taking on an impossible task in hopes of success. This idea strikes home to a lot of starry-eyed geeks. Even to me, sometimes.

Problem is, <a href="http://www.mythweb.com/encyc/entries/sisyphus.html">Sisyphus' story</a> is not one of success. And while the valley wallows in sisyphanaticism it ignores the other side of the proverbial hill. 

The other side of the hill, if Sisyphus could ever reach it, would be a totally different environment; one where things move relatively quickly and succesfully. One where momentum builds and anything in your way gets steamrolled. One where <em>trying to stop the boulder</em> is now an exercise in futility.

I'm reminded of this when reading the comments in this article. Many people who rooted for  the underdog now rue it's bountiful existence.  My suggestion? Stop hating.

Don't hate the player, hate the game. It's a nasty hardcore world; there has to be big players and casualties. Think of it like God Emperor of Dune--there has to be a big, seemingly invincible monstrosity in order to create something to destroy the monopolistic rule of the behemoth.

So stop your pansy sisyphanatic whining and do  what Google did. That is unless you like eternal suffering....
