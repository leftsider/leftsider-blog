Why does everyone decide to message me while I'm set to away? No one messages when I'm set to available....

What is up with my ISP??? I can get 10mbps up/100mbps down for w36,000/mo with KT Megapass but with my stupid ISP I'm getting speeds of 5-800kpbs DOWN for w35,000. Huh???

Why do I bother asking for help? I ask the secretary to call my ISP and  find out my login and password for online services....she calls schedules a service technician to come out. *groan*

Why am I using a Mac in Korea? Most people here have trouble understanding I'm not on PC; I DON'T USE Windows ANYTHING. No matter how many times you hit windows commands on my APPLE keyboard, you're not going to go anywhere. And there's no "X" at the top right. No, that button is not an "X" and I'm going to throttle you in 5 seconds...

Why do service technicians love to hate on my router? This is a bi-continental issue; anything that doesn't work or doesn't work well that you can't find must be the router. What did my router do to you?

It's really hard for me to not feel excluded when I can't play online games, shop online, or log in to many Korean portals because it requires a citizen's (not resident's) ID number. Way to keep it in the family...

And what the heck is up with Camino when it hits a graphic intensive site? All Korean portals take my browser to a crawl. And I'm totally not ok with the entire community
<a title="CamiFlash - MozillaZine Forums" href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=242830&highlight=flash korean">accepting a plugin that prevents flash auto-loading</a> as a solution. Huh???

I took a painful dump this morning. So I'm in a bad mood. Business as usual tomorrow.
