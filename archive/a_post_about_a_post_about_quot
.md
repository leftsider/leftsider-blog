<a title="Anil Dash: Quotes" href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/11/09/quotes">Anil Dash: Quotes</a>

There is something that just screams "boring" about posting a link to another blog's listing of interesting quotes. Let's face it: a post of quotes is pretty boring on its own.

That's what I thought when I noticed Anil's entry in my bloated reader; I'm glad, however, that I didn't skip it. First one may be the coolest quote I've read in a while.
