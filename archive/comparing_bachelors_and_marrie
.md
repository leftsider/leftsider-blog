<blockquote>So I've come to the conclusion that some men never change no matter what age they are. 총각 or 아저씨, they're all the same. I guess that's why we women both love and hate them--for they never seem to grow up and are always kids at heart whether endearingly or not.</blockquote>

It's the truth, I admit it.
