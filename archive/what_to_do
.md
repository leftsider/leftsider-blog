<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	When you've got three days to explore dozens of islands, the schedule fills up fast. It was not helpful when it decided to rain the entirety of the first day. The next day the troops were eager to get out there--somewhere--and enjoy Bocas.<br />
<br />
We hooked up with some ladies that Tav had met while waiting at the docks and visited the islands Zapatilla and Red Frog. Good times. Everyone was pretty tired afterwards. It was Good Friday as well, so everything was closed and, to everyone else's chagrin, alcohol was not for sale. So it was a pretty quiet night for all.
