"Geoffrey Vos QC, representing Apple Corps, told Mr Justice Mann at the high court in London in March that to call the download system just an electronic device was a "perversion" of the constraints laid down in the agreement between the two companies.

He said Steve Jobs, who founded Apple Computer, had said that the downloading of music from the internet was exactly the same as buying an LP in the modern world."

So the world where, 3 years ago, 1million songs were downloaded from itunes is not the modern world? Or, more accurately, the Beatles were not part of the post-modern world?
