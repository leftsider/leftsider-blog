<blockquote>Seo Woo-seok, a professor at the University of Seoul's College of Urban Science, said Koreans’ confidence in their ability to overcome social obstacles has weakened and the nation’s growth engines such as aspirations to greater democracy have faded over the last 20 years.</blockquote>

The article says that the idea of a unified Korea is steadily becoming a pipe dream to South Koreans, but they assert that the reasoning is because the prospect of economic growth has become more appealing. 

I find this interesting after reading <a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200701/200701020021.html">this tidbit</a> from the same paper, on the same day. Now that Korea is slated to be next to last in economic growth in 2007, do you think that would rejuvenate the reunification spirit again? Just thinking.
