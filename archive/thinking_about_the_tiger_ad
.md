BODY:
A friend of mine gave a very "instant reaction" [write-up of the Tiger Woods ad](http://jodikiely.com/2010/04/08/my-reaction-to-nike%E2%80%99s-post-scandal-tiger-woods-ad/) that caused such a firestorm a few weeks ago. I replied, and thought I'd share my reply here for posterity. Click through to read my response.

EXTENDED BODY:
I'm still torn over the ad. I don't think it is as cohesive as it could be. That said, I think it does send a useful message.

The commercial shows Tiger as a loser. As you said, there is nothing about the to make you want to buy into Tiger or Nike. From a marketing perspective, this is revolutionary-I can't remember seeing anything similar.

If there's one concurrent theme floating about Nike's sea of ads shown in the last 20 years, it is this: let the athletes speak for themselves. Sure they showcase the technology and embrace the cool, but there is nothing that overshadows the athlete herself. Subsequently, Nike ads perpetually cater to the athlete because they see themselves.

It is an extension of the iconic "Just Do It" slogan; what the endorser conveys is something that the athlete watching either can do, has done, or is doing.

For us, presumably, there is less of a connection, but is there an element of this ad that is lost on us yet hits home for athletes? Does the dumbfounded stare, the echo of a hero's words, and the ragged end of a highlight review reel (which I initially confused as flashbulbs) speak volumes to that subset. I think Nike's hoping so.

Again, I'm not sold on it. I think it's a bold approach and a gamble. Clearly there are mixed reviews. But I can believe in that a bit more than a "welcome back" ad-which would put me in mind of Bush's "Mission Accomplished." And I hope that this signals Tiger's intent: a commitment to grow in the light of his loss (scandal) and move to another win (Masters).
