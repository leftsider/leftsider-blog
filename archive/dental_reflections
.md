BODY:
I've been spending a significant amount of time in the dental office recently. Nothing too bad, but because I've been without a dentist for about 3-4 years, it definitely was overdue.

I've decided that I probably would not make a good dentist or dental hygienist. The primary reason is because of my attention to detail. I love making things just right, and it would seem to be a problem if my patients had to endure me an extra 30 minutes so that I could perfect what was already just fine. Imagine their horror as I place sharp, pointy objects in their mouth and strive for the pinnacle of dental repair. 

Speaking of focus and diligence, I was fascinated by how quickly I became a non-person once in the chair. As my hygienist received me we chatted amicably, cracking jokes and talking intelligently. Once my mouth opened, however, I became a task--an assignment. I guess it helps that you're unable to talk while someone's hands are in your mouth, but what I initially thought was a glaze-over what actually an acute focus of attention to work. Dental practitioners pore over their work in the same way that a surgeon does, or an engineer, or a top-notch college student. Or an honest cubicle drone, for that matter.

Questions from these visits: At what point does excellent work cross the line into <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/80520208.html">painful precision</a>? What are the rules of social interaction when you are a non-person? Not only in the chair at the dental office, but at the massage parlor, the shoe store, the makeup counter. Do we ever put those who work for us in a non-person role? The bus boy, the bus driver, the cashier?

Re: non-persons: it's obviously a very uncomfortable issue for a lot of people, but I think you're getting at something which is critical to service design, and too rarely acknowledged let alone faced. I've thought about it a little bit in the context of hotels.

In service design, the non-person is essential to allow the customer detachment from the sobering details of what they are requesting. Unfortunately, it would seem that in many service areas this balance is taken for granted by the recipient and under-utilized by the service provider. It is, however, a known--especially for those who find themselves partaking in activities on a side that is different from their norm (affluent kid living in the slums through college, successful prodigy revisiting family and humble roots).

What fascinated me most about this encounter, however, was that it seemed that I, the service  recipient was the one who became the non-person. Despite my efforts at apparel, educated wit and charm, I was reduced to 32 teeth, all carrying their own individual character and flair. 

While unnerving, I think it was ideal. I would rather become a non-person to receive good service than to be pampered and wooed with no real attention to the quality being given. Perhaps this also ties into service design; would I rather receive a king's welcome or service fit for one?
