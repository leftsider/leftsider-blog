I'll be changing my usage of twitter. Again.

1. **Every twitter account I'm even remotely intrigued by, I will follow.** I am cultivating my own [public timeline](http://twitter.com/public_timeline). I want to expand what I hear from the twitter community from my own valuations (rather than external [suggestions](http://blog.twitter.com/2010/01/power-of-suggestions.html) or [trends](http://twittercism.com/local-trends/))
2. **I will use twitter's "lists" feature to focus on specific twitterers that, for [one reason](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/06/old-birds-new-tune.html) or another, catch my attention.** If anyone from twitter reads this, *it'd be a great feature to have the ability to select a "list" as your "home" page.* I want to easily cut the noise and receive the signal, making twitter *actually useful.*
3. **The "reply" feature will be deprecated.** If I need to reply to someone, it will be a complete tweet thought that can stand alone; otherwise, I'll defer to the "direct message" feature. I now think the twitter team had the right idea when they ["fixed replies"](http://mashable.com/2009/05/13/fixreplies/); without context, replies lose usefulness. Now that I stream my tweets on Leftsider, and [Google shows tweets in search results](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/rt-google-tweets-and-updates-and-search.html), my tweets are being asked to mature a bit.

As I have pretty much abandoned [twitter SMS usage](http://help.twitter.com/forums/59008/entries) (thanks, iPhone apps!), it no longer is important that I keep my following number low--especially since twitter now allows me to select which tweets to send. A lot of people who were snubbed or axed by my notorious "following 79" rule may find themselves back on board. This, I expect, will also affect my recent follower plateau.

From a few random strangers to *practically everyone I meet these days*, twitter certainly is a different animal. I'd be interested in knowing how other people are taming the beast.
