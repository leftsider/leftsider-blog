BODY:
A theory, based on some things I haven't mentioned.

The things that I have not mentioned officially are that Frulwinn and I are using <a href="http://www.helio.com">Helio</a> as our mobile provider and that I have been accepted as a member of <a href="http://www.cyworld.com">Cyworld</a>. Also, I've decided to do my Anthropology class mini-ethnograpy on the Cyworld experience.

Here's the theory: prepare to bow to your Korean overlords. The Borg is coming and you will be assimilated. 

To spare you who prefer to lightly peruse, I'll explain more after the jump.

EXTENDED BODY:
Helio, the MNVO partnership between Earthlink and SK (Korea's largest mobile communications company) has gotten off to a rough start, to be honest. Our phones are way cool, but the plans are pricey, the internet connectivity is spotty (granted I've only used mobile phone internet in Korea), and the content is slim at best. Add to that technical issues with Korean text messages, international messaaging, and MMS.....it's a wonder it hasn't folded already. I've really been disappointed sofar, and cannot recommend the service.

Just a few weeks ago I finally obtained the green light for membership to Cyworld. I had been halfheartedly attempting to do it all through my time in Korea, and worked at it in earnest once I returned to the US. Now that I had it, the next thing I wanted to do was use it on the go--like I would in Korea. The fact that I had a Korean phone powered by a Korean telecom giant made it seem like a no-brainer to me. Boy was I wrong.

My vendor of choice (who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/25/AR2006062500763.html">happens to be Korean</a>) called Helio and pitched a fit when he discovered the problems we were having and the fact that Cyworld is not accessible through the phones. "Isn't this done with SK? What Korean doesn't have Cy?" he berated, in Korean. "If this can't be fixed, then they should be able to cancel their account with no penalties!" The Korean-speaking CSR quietly acquiesed.

Meanwhile, I became more and more fascinated with Cy. Not that there's anything there that I'm particularly interested  in, but that all my friends are there, and all their friends as well....and about a third of the Korean population while we're at it. What makes it so popular? I chose it as my ethnographical topic as an excuse to spend more time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyworld">figuring it out</a>.

Here's what I discoveed. I knew that Cy was a part of Nate, but I did not know that Cy was purchased by SK a few years ago and bundled wtih Nate upon acquisition. Nate, you may recall, is the company that took Microsoft to court under the claim that MS messenger's inclusion in the Windows OS was monopolistic and unfair to their messaging client NateOn. I also discovered that Cyworld actually has a US version in closed beta as we speak.

Rolling all these things in my head, I came to see a larger plan forming. Cy-US will open, and then Helio will provide access and receive content from it. Helio's partnership with Myspace is merely a way to work out the kinks while the Beta hashes out its issues. Cy-ROK would not be advantageous to implement here in the US since it requires your Korean ID (or a long, untranslated, foreigner submission). And all that wonkiness with the messaging may be a result of this preparation.

Imagine, if you will, an online social networking site that is accessible via the web or by an application on your mobile device. No matter where you access it you will be able to edit your site, upload and download pictures, visit your friend's sites, and communicate via IM. What you are imagining is Cy in Korea. And you are looking at the foundations of that same system being built here in US. 

I think it's a bold, smart move by SK. Anyone looking to get in while the cement's still curing, I'm available to teach you basic Korean via IM for a reasonable cost. :)

I need to get that Cyworld account going...I'm about halfway through the process myself.
