<blockquote>Fazlulla believes the handwritten pages are crucial to the paper and to the tradition of handwritten Urdu.

For centuries, handwriting was the definitive mark of social status, education and liberal values in India. Calligraphers mastered the swooping Urdu script in ivory-tower institutions and penned copies of the Koran for wealthy patrons. The pinnacle of a katib's achievement meant a seat at court and a chance to earn the sultan's ear.</blockquote>

When I talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Human-computer_interaction">human-computer interaction</a>, I'm not going down the general route that encompasses usability, intuitive user interfaces and task efficiency. These things are all important, but not the focus of my passion.

Instead, I am concerned about stories like this. Sure, a surface technology enabled table is nice, but what excites me is that perhaps it is one step closer to creating an interface that saves this time-honored tradition of calligraphy so steeped in culture and history. One must wonder, however, if technology will serve this purpose in time.

Can you really say that nothing is lost when a language may have its hand-written methods replaced by computer input only? This is <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/handwriting_the_lost_art.htm">not just a problem existing outside the US</a>. Can interaction design provide a way for us to avoid technology's current tendency to <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/05/now_that_the_semester_is.htm">erase existing culture</a>?
