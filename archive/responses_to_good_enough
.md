BODY:
Thanks to longtime twitter pal @stuyparker[ * ](http://twitter.com/stuyparker), who introduced me (via twitter) to @afg85[ * ](http://twitter.com/afg85), who I met in person last week and promptly started debating with. :)

In response to the bit of postulating [*](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2011/01/good-enough.html) I posted last week, he kindly responded with an entry on his own blog [ *](http://cloudculturecontent.blogspot.com/2011/01/our-vast-digital-wealth.html). He contends two things which conflict with what I wrote.


-----
EXTENDED BODY:
The first contradicts my premise that the industrial revolution changed the definition of quality from the valuation of usefulness to the gradation of production. Instead he argues that what the industrial revolution brought about was a change of focus from the wealthy to the commoner--who could now afford clothing at the factory-reduced prices. I disagree with this categorically: the life of the commoner did not improve during the time period [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Acts)  nor is there any indication I see of factories focusing on a different consumer market or even creating something different than what was generated in more traditional settings[ * ](http://www.suite101.com/content/the-rise-of-factories-a97774). In fact, given the high startup cost of developing a factory, my guess is that outside of the (admittedly large) cotton industry most factories created products specifically for high cost.

Even so, is providing goods for common usage enough to change the concept of quality? or to develop an atmosphere of satisfaction? Would not the access to greater material goods eliminate the need to make do? Disposability would certainly persist but the two together are key to innovation.

The second argument he makes is to a comment I left. When he suggested that the beauty of digitization is that now we can "live like the rich," without earnest care for the scarcity of goods, I said:

> I really hope we don't succumb to the idea that "we can live like the rich." This encourages excess, graft, corruption and malevolence.

This, of course, is a strong statement, but one I feel is true. he argues:

> All I can say is this: historically, the wealthy have contributed larger shares of their income to charity, and to patronage of the arts. It is difficult to imagine a renaissance without the generous patronage of the Medicis.

It would be foolish to argue that the affluent have not had a positive influence on society, or to say that all rich people are evil. I suggest neither. Instead, I repeat what I tweeted recently:

It is not the rich I consider worrisome, it is those who imagine what it means to be rich[ * ](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/12/big-meals-overpopulation-and-i.html) that garner the greatest concern. As we learn to live digital, I hope we learn to live as efficiently as the medium. The examples of profit-over-humanity leave little to be desired of the live like the rich mentality. I'd much rather be persistent, be innovative[*](http://www.afrigadget.com/2009/06/15/football-handmade-in-south-africa/) like those who must be as a means of their own survival[ * ](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html?pagewanted=4)(paragraph 6).

Innovation is not a privilege, nor is it only afforded to the privileged. Innovation is driven by need, which is not the opposite of wealth. The digital revolution we currently are participating in is propelled as much by the poor as by the rich, as much by the amateur as by the professional[ * ](http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9916588-54.html).

OK, so I think I can see where we may not have managed to communicate what we meant to one another.

I wasn't saying that we can live like the rich, as in, this is something we have aspired to and can now do. In no way am I talking about the pursuit of wealth.

Instead, what I am saying is that if you have access to a computer and the internet, then in terms of anything that can be turned into a digital file, you are mega-rich compared to how much (music, writing, pictures, video) people could afford--either to consume or to make and display publicly--in the past. That's all I'm saying.

I present it not as a stricture of what should be the case or how we should be behaving now. I present it instead as fact--as makers and consumers of content, we are now mega-wealthy. And I believe understanding the implications of that is an important component to understanding how people are likely to behave in our digital, interconnected age.

If I understand you correctly, Adam, what you're actually saying is that the *capacity* for growth and development has increased due to technological advancement. I can't imagine anyone would argue that. We have more than we're able to effectively absorb and even that is beyond what our predecessors of just a few generations could have even imagined. Yes, absolutely.

But the term "rich" is associated with quantity, not capacity, and an excess of the latter is a lot less likely to lead to inequality. If I have a cup and you have a jug, we both can drink from the stream; if it comes to storage of a quantity of water, however, you have the advantage. If it comes to portability or small portions, I can leverage that against your reluctance to share what you've stored. Quantity is where supply and demand seek profit--which is where it is easy to sacrifice society for economy. 

In the digital world, everyone with a digital computing device has a tremendous capacity--to create, to modify, to duplicate and distribute. Private commercial interests fear such a capacity because it threatens the value of the quantity they provide. They are *rich*, and they can be quite nefarious at protecting/maintaining/enhancing their wealth.

I advocate looking beyond wealth to the public ability of self-provision.
