<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Tet41mhnI">This</a> is Tomoko Kawase, more commonly known these days as <a title="Artist Wiki: Tommy february6 - Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy%20february6/ wiki">Tommy february6</a>. I first learned of her when watching the anime <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Kiss">Paradise Kiss</a>, which used her song "Lonely in Gorgeous" for the opening credits (they used Franz Ferdinand for the closing. Excellent!).

Hunting up info on Tommy february6, I discovered that it was her solo act after being lead singer of j-rock/alternative band <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Ugo3XkCi0">the brilliant green</a>. A totally different sound, so I was impressed by the difference. 

But then I ran into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwGPABuvxoY&NR">Tommy heavenly6</a>, which is Tommy february6's polar opposite/alter ego. In case you've missed it: Tomoko's solo stage character has an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9fqSW43brQ">alternate stage character</a> (It's all explained in the wiki linked earlier). Add to that the fact that the backup dancer cheerleaders in her videos, the <em>TommyAngels</em>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myrgKSdriyc&mode=related&search=">also have a video</a>....and you really are left wondering how far down the rabbit hole can go.

Is this really ok? Is it unprecedented genius? The fact that so much spawned from so little (some might argue from nothing at all, talentwise) is very interesting. How many manifestations of leftsider could I get away with? :D

Ha! you're right.
The Mick Foley/Mankind/Dude Love saga is another excellent example of this. I wonder if this marketing tactic has a name?
