I can't find an excuse to have a kid.<br /><br />I like kids. I dote on them, try to be an example to them, try to inspire them and encourage and validate their inquisitive tendencies. I love to ruffle their hair in that older brother way and corral them into an affirming squeeze. <b>I think this is one of the most important things I can do for my society.</b> And I think they really appreciate it; I guess.<br /><br />But for the most part, I pity them. Many times they are the product of a na√Øve wish or lack of planning. When they are realistically and properly realized, they are often meticulously bred to be the crowning achievement of their parents wishes and aspirations. I think it most selfish to have a child to create a new, improved version of you. Increasingly I think the answer is to let a child be who they can be (an intentional alternative from letting them be who they are).<br /><br />Still, I have love to give. I energy and emotional support to offer in the development of life. In fact, <b>I believe this is my most important mission as a world citizen.</b> If this is what I'm going to do, and I intend to do it objectively, do I have to create a new life to do it? Adoption seems the most logical option.<br /><br />We've talked a bit about this, and we're kinda set on it. But in our minds, the concept of having a family always invloved <i>children</i>, not a child. Why? Because we are both of the opinion that an only child has less incentive to embrace concepts like sharing and collaboration. Regardless of the validity of that statement, it brings out a horrible and calculating reality: <b>Our only reason for a second child would be to improve the outlook of the first.</b> No doubt we could love and cherish that child, but their existence is as a component, not at all independently valid. I think this is most heartless. <br /><br />So now I need to learn to appreciate the single child concept, or resign myself to no children at all? I have a tendency to be excessive in contemplation, so maybe I'm overthinking this. Maybe there's a better option I haven't though of? <br />
