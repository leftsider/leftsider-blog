The Korea Times : 61% of Parents Receptive to International Marriage
</a>

I find this VERY questionable for numerous reasons. I'll leave it up to you to make your own opinion. Interesting to note, however:

"Females accounted for more than 90 percent of foreign spouses, with 54,533, due to the increasing number of marriages between Korean males and women from Southeast Asian countries that are arranged by marriage agencies."

So much for the "stealing our women" argument. That actually suprised me.
