BODY:
This weekend we dropped by a friend's house with a movie and snacks in tow. The movie? A Korean comedy translated as "<a href="http://www.hancinema.net/korean_movie_My_Boss_v__My_Teacher.php">My Boss, My Teacher</a>." The friends? My pal Paul (the guy who got me started studying korean and a major influence in going over there) and his Korean wife, Sook Kyung. 

Paul is a bit of a film snob. He's not a full on blowhard; actually, it'd probably be more accurate to say that he has his own unique taste. He tries to explain and rationalize it, but really it all boils down to personal preference. While I can definitely figure out what movies he disdains, I'd be hard pressed to explain what type of movie he enjoys; for this reason, I guess I'll take back the film snob title and replace it with a title of eccentricity.

The reason that I explain this is because Paul thought the movie was awful. Sook Kyung liked it. Fru got a good laugh out of it, and I validated it for what it was--a modern Korean comedy.

If you've looked into Korean film recently, you'd have noticed this progressing trend:
<blockquote>1. A Korean comedy must involve a cop, a gangster, and/or a high school student (romantic comedies can opt out if they include a horribly mismatched pairing)
2. A Korean comedy must get serious for approximately 20 minutes around the 4th quarter of the film.
3. A Korean comedy gets its laughs not from the jokes told but from the characters' reactions to various events.
4. A Korean comedy invariably has a relatively horrible ending. No unpredicted twists, no cliffhangers.</blockquote>

For a guy like Paul, and for most of the Western world, this kind of movie gets the "cheesy" stamp. Most people don't like cheese in their films, and so these would probably classify as straight-to-video fodder. Paul noted that night that it seemed that Korean cinema was full of horrible attempts at filmaking and that he could almost count on one hand how many movies he felt were top-notch. 

I argued that this was not to Korean cinema's fault. One must understand that the culture, the mindset, and the demand is different there than it is in a country like ours. 

If Korea is anything, it is pop. It is sensationalist, it is surreal; it feeds off of dreams and imagination and strong emotion. Korean soaps, music videos--even news--all attest to this. It's not about substance; it's about zeitgeist.

Movies that delve deep in to plot or analytical thought are relegated to small openings and arthouse scenes. Same with music. As I debated this, I pointed to <a href="http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com/">RHCP</a>'s nauseating performance on Saturday Night Live and asked him to think of any Korean musician who had been around as long as these guys and still got on a Saturday night show (besides an old-school <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ds5ErbbIFxo">"gayo" special</a>) to perform their music. He conceded this point.

While I don't think we came to complete agreement, I think it's a worthwhile argument. Just like the US rap/hiphop scene, Korea's entertainment culture is not even set up to have long-standing stars and ideologies. People and fancies come and go like the wind, so it's ridiculous to assume that you'll find poignancy and depth in a comedy. Don't set yourself up for disappointment.

I thought this was interesting though, because I hadn't actually approached Korean society from that perspective. I t hought it was worth noting and discussing further.

Interesting insight.  I've been in Korea for four years but I'm just getting into Korean movies.  Your thoughts on Korean cinema as a reflection of the ever-changing pop culture scene is consistent with my observations.  

It is natural and easy, though unfair, to apply the same standards of judgement to Korean movies, music, and literature as we do to our own.  That said, I believe Korean media has yet to come of age.

Thanks for commenting!

I believe that Korean media has come of age--after all, their history is much longer than the US. And as long as there are people making history, there are people sharing the news. That, ideally, is media.

In a broader scope, movies essentially reflect the essence of the people. Their thoughts, where they are personally. Anything that tries to promote something otherwise is usually discredited as propaganda. 

To that end, Korean cinema must be exactly the age of the people. Thinking that way, the only reason Korean media in general could be considered yet to come of age would be if the Korean people are yet to come of age. And that's a whole 'nother topic. ;)
