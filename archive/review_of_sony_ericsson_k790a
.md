<blockquote>Mobile phone manufacturers are a lot like... hibiscus leaves? Hotel chains? Umm.. zoo animals! Sure! Nokia is like a cotton-topped tamarin, all preened and fancy and slick, but yet there's something about them makes you want to punch them in the face. Motorola's phones are like an giraffe, sleek and impressive from a distance, but rough, gangly, and awkward up close, and then they honk and spit garbage on your pants. Samsung is like a dromedary camel... oh, for goodness sakes, this is terrible.

Here's what I'm trying to say. Until Apple becomes the Apple of Mobile Phones, we have Sony Ericsson. </blockquote>

Oh my goofy gulai is he right. My classmate has this phone and I nearly creamed in my pants. I know that is so totally offensive as that it would never be on this site....but that's really how I felt. Like it was something sexual. This is the first cellphone envy I've felt since I returned from Korea....and boy did it hit me hard.
