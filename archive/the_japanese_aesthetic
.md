I wish more people took time to appreciate Japanese aesthetic.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>This entry does a great job of comparing what is and what isn't.

It juxtaposes well with this passage I tweeted recently from the Wikipedia "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi" title="Wabi-sabi" rel="wikipedia">wabi sabi</a>" entry:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div>According to Koren, wabi-sabi is the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of what we think of as traditional Japanese beauty and it "occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese pantheon of aesthetic values as do the Greek ideals of beauty and perfection in the West." Andrew Juniper claims, "if an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi." Richard R. Powell summarizes by saying "It (wabi-sabi) nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect."</div></blockquote>
