Since I've been recently shown some blog love by none other than <a href="http://theassimilatednegro.blogspot.com/2006/02/and-i-heard-em-say-sex-is-never.html">Mr. TAN himself</a>, I've decided to pull out one that I've been sitting on for a while. About a month ago, over some trivial and triffling thing, I whimsically uttered, "Just like black people." The problem is, I wasn't talking about blacks; I was talking about Koreans.

Immediately <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">my wife</a> and my friend Robert questioned me about my rationale. We all live in Korea, and it's nothing at all like being at home. But being one who refuses to back down easily, I argued my case--much to their amusement. And so, today, I present to you a few things that Koreans and black Americans seem to share.

<ol><li><strong>Things.</strong> Haha I know that's painfully faceless, but work with me. As I study Korean and Korean culture, I'm always encountering people who write things off as only understood by Koreans. It's kinda ridiculous when you spend most of your day looking at Korean customs and traditions--of course you know about it, then--but someone will insist: "It's just a part of our culture; it won't make sense but that's how it is." So reminiscent of "<a href="http://www.itsablackthang.com/">It's a black thing</a>; you wouldn't understand."</li>
<li><strong>Home Cooking. </strong>Somewhat related to the first, Koreans are especially fond of traditional meals. Come to Korea, and someone will shortly invite you to a traditional meal--just like mom used to make. Problem is, most of the time it'll be to a restaurant; these home cooked meals are becoming more and more of a rarity in modern living.
I grew up in a more rural area, so I've had my share of down home cookin'. And we love to reminisce of its virtues, swearing it the best, illogically healthy, and even a source of strength and virility. Yeah; it's just like that here in Korea.</li>
<li><strong>Percussional Proclivity. </strong>Parade? Holiday? Traditional celebration? Bring out the drums. Jumping around and dancin' the fool to nothing but drums and cymbals once meant that I was attending a <a href="http://www.collegeview.com/articles/CV/hbcu/halftime_dreams.html">HBCU competition</a>. Today it means some Korean is keeping it real. Oratorical history is usually perfomed with a drum as well.</li>
<li><strong>Hustlin'. </strong>This was the original point of contention. To be more polite to both sides, I will formally call it "entrepreneurial creativity and unconventional resourcefulness." From getting things done cheap to making a profit where there is none, both black Americans and Koreans can be matchless geniuses. Can be; doesn't mean they always are.</li>
<li><strong>Pride.</strong> When it comes down to it, no one loves you more than you love yourself. Both Koreans and black Americans know this all to well. Forced servitude and the general "raw deal" are in both histories. So is emancipation and revitalization. Now, it seems, we both spend a lot of our time validating ourselves to the world at large.</li></ol>

Ok so there are a few. Hope this is helpful to you, though I can imagine how. Maybe it can be a bridge between black and korean americans? No....<a href="http://asiapages.typepad.com/the_asia_pages/2006/02/gyopos_and_kore.html">Jodi says koreans and gyopos are too different</a>. Hmm. Maybe the secret for <a href="http://lostnomad.blogs.com/the_lost_nomad/2006/02/the_la_times_on.html">Ward Hines' success</a>? Maybe not. If you do find it useful, kindly let me know. See any points I missed? Share them, would you?
