The market for extremely small cars is getting bigger as Toyota will introduce a two-seater called the Aygo in 2008, according to Edmunds. 

Hahaha....am I the only one that notices this car's name is surprising ly similar to the Korean lament "아이구..."? With only 68 horsepower, perhaps it'd be prudent for owners to learn that phrase....
