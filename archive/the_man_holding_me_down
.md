BODY:
Yesterday I skipped work to catch up on some languishing studies, mostly Japanese. I woke up, called in, went back to bed, got up again, locked myself in an empty room (Fru was also working from home so I didn't want to be distracted) and studied in earnest for 5-6 hours. 

To be honest, it felt really good. Doing nothing but learning is not as boring as one might assume. And when I crawled out of that room I felt accomplished, a little closer to current as far as school goes.

Most notably, I felt a clarity that my mind had been without for a while. An empty head is really a great thing (thinking about David Allen's concept). And it showed; before the day was done I had two really significant epiphanies and a couple fascinating conversations during my class that evening. 

Driving home I wondered if it was coincidence that the one day I don't deal with office issues is the day that all my ideas bubble over to the surface. Could it be that my work is cooling my jets? Or, to its defense, am I not approaching work in a way that it can fuel my thinking?

Lots of things to think about. Unfortunately I'll have to schedule that think time in as the office is back with a vengance. :)

Oooh, it looks different around here.

I wonder if you're using GTD at work.

Admittedly, I haven't yet. Still working through the book/audiobook.

Being the procrastinating perfectionist that I am, I've been spending a lot of time THINKING about the proper implementation. I was planning to write a little about that...thanks for the prompt.

So often I daisy-chain my way to a task completely arbitrary to my intent. GTD should be a lifesaver for me.

I'd encourage you to forget pursuing the proper implementation and start with just one thing this week. Collecting is where it starts, and all you need is a pen and paper.

Oh I'm a fantastic collector. I'm always found with a notepad or a journal. It's the examination process that the real issue--probably why I'm also spending so much time with the much more natural-to-me listing part.

Then I'd encourage you just to start implementing. Keep it simple, and work from there. There is no perfect implementation.

You'll love the results.
