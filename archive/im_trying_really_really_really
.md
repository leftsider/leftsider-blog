BODY:
I'm trying really, really, REALLY hard to be a good worker and get everything done, knowing that classes start next week. And then I'm going to really, really, REALLY dedicate time to study. So, as you can see, the amount of content here is slowing down. 

Leftsider never dies, though. Never.

Just out of curiosity, are you familiar with David Allen's "Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"?

I have, though I haven't read it. My problem isn't about finding ways to do things; it's actually doing them. Low motivation is a bastard.

Also, I'm still kinda dealing with the whole "being back in the US" thing. I don't feel completely on the ball, in general.

I understand...reverse culture shock can be a pain to handle.

Still, GTD might be just what you're looking for. Low motivation and low energy aren't all that different, and GTD might be a good tool to fight your way through it.
