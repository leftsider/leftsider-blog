Mildy interesting exhibition, but the picture of the wall-mounted ipod reminded me of an experience we had while visiting in Tokyo.

The second evening we wandered around Shibuya just seeing what was around and peeking into shops. One street was particularly nice and had more than one gallery or store that put me face to face with things that I had previously only seen in publications like <em>Wallpaper</em> and websites like <em>we make money not art</em>. On this street, whe stopped into a small boutique store/gallery that had four ipods mounted on its large front window. Under each ipod was a black circle, also installed into the window. 

I looked at the setup and surmised that the black circles were used as some sort of sensor, which controlled which ipod played music inside the store. Upon entering the store and seeing the turntables in the back, spinning away, I soon realized that the ipods were just ipods--the black circles were headphone jacks that passers-by could plug into and just listen.

Using the ipods in this way, and with no incentive to move people any further than the storefront window, was completely fascinating to me. 

I should have taken a picture, but I was (probably unnecessarily) concerned with the store and artists' feelings about their work and ideas being photographed.
