Calacanis breaks the social news model up into three strata -- the 1% who oversee the majority of the site's content and who define the site's culture, the 19% who contribute stories and comment prolifically and the 80% who are solely consumers of the news.

Calacanis pays his 1%, which is what the debate is really about.
