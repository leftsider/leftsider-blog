I have basically been converted to Mac, but I refuse to commit simply because some things really irk me about how Apple does some things. Here's a perfect example:

I've never been a big fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a>. When transferring my PC's music library to my new iBook, files were copied in an unrecognizable sequence....which meant when the network connection hiccuped I got stuck with about 70 half-albums. In addition, it did not give me the option of controlling how my files were stored, as RealPlayer and WMP had....and turned a dozen or so compilation albums into about 50 one-song folders. I was not amused. To say we started off on a bad foot would be an understatement.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/">ITMS </a>was initially guilty by association. If you sleep with the devil, you can't really be all that good for me. Later, as netizens bemoaned the DRM issues that prevented them from using media as they wished, I took it as a sign not to bother. iPod? No thank you. At this point my PocketPC and gig SDcard are suiting quite nicely. With that, I turned my back to popularity and was essentially labeled a hipster by many associates for my refusal to go mainstream.

Well this week we've got iTunes7, And one of the things that I found most interesting about the newest incarnation of the beast is that it would allow you to get album covers from ITMS--provided that you had an account. Refusing to hold a grudge, I decided to open one and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/09/hazards_and_surprises_with_itu.html">see how well it did with my eclectic and very elusive music collection</a>.

I followed the create account option in the menu.
It took me to the license agreement for getting an ITMS account.....in Australia (this MAY be my fault).
I clicked the link they offered to those of us who were from a different country.
It took me to a list of permissioned countries. I chose USA (tangent: do you think Korea will ever be ITMS-friendly? ha.).
The ITMS main page USA pops up. I hunt for the signup area, settling on "account"
The popup asks for my APPLE ID. Nice! I have one of those <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/15384374/">from the battery recall</a> so I throw it in.
ERROR. My address listed is still of Daegu. And it's got credit card info.....how'd it get that?
I clear the credit card info and update the address. ERROR. No credit card info.

I don't really need to give credit card info just to sign up, do I? The cover art is free, isn't it? What's this all about? I decide that perhaps I'm at an area that is optional; after all, I was looking to create an account in the first place. Let's go back to the main page.

This time I notice the "Sign In" button in the top right. Click.
Back to the popup. But now I see there's a "Create Account" button in the bottom left. 
Back to the USA ITMS license agreement. Agree. 
Hey! they've remember my email addy and put it there for me! Nice! Add a password. Repeat.
ERROR. This email is already in use with an APPLE account. 

So I'm actually thinking to myself, "Ok, so let me use another account and open up this....wha???? All this for some CD covers? This is SO not worth the aggravation.

So I still haven't become one of the many. Curse you, iTunes.  Your forced compliance doesn't work with me. And don't get me started on your boy, iPhoto....
