<blockquote>
Value laptops don’t always have to mean you end up with a hunk of junk and a blinking cursor staring back at you. Great notebook computers exist out there for under $1,000, having become more and more of a reality as prices on components like processors, RAM and hard drives continue to fall. While not all computers in this price range will have Windows Vista installed on them, some are ready to update when you are. And if you aren’t in a hurry to upgrade, you can find some great deals on Windows XP laptops. </blockquote>
