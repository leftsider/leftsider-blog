	After a day of downtime it was New Year's Eve! What to do, what to do??? I had an idea to go to Sentosa Island, and the fact that there were ads everywhere about the Sentosa celebrations made my tentative plan a little more concrete.<br />
<br />
Then I talked to an online pal who lives in S'pore and they mentioned that Ministry of Sound (if you don't know, I can't explain) had opened a venue in Clark Quay just a few weeks before. Being the music/dancing freak that I am, all logic went out the window and I was determined this was the best place to spend NYE.<br />
<br />
It probably would have been. However, a couple thousand other people had the same idea. New years came with us about 1/3 of the way through the queue, and we didn't get in until nearly 2am. Even so it was a blast--easily the best party I've ever been to--and we had a lot of fun until we dragged ourselves into our room around 6am.<br />
<br />
After another day of downtime, we headed out to Sentosa. Immediately I recognized the error in my ways: MoS was great for clubbing, but Sentosa would have been FANTASTIC for NYE. The place is laid out very nice with lots of beautiful things to do and see (check the pics in Flickr). I felt kinda selfish and bad after this realization.<br />
<br />
Anyway Sentosa was beautiful with Merlion, the city mascot, watching over us all as we wandered about.
