I'd like to think that I'm greener than the average living person, but I'm basing that mainly on philosophical conclusion and less on actual recordable action. I recycle; I commute with my wife when going to work and I walk or bus home in the afternoons. I look for ways to use existing services rather than creating my own. But I still think I'd be pretty brown overall. :(
