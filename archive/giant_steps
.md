BODY:
I've always had this vision in my head of making music videos for certain songs. I'm not actually interested in being a music video director; rather, some songs just invoke a mental panorama that is just so beautiful. 

I've tried a couple times, but, unfortunately, my drawing/flash skills were always low enough that it made a project of such a labor which seemed insurmountable.

<a title="Giant Steps by Michal Levy" href="http://michalevy.com/gs_main.html">Giant Steps by Michal Levy</a> makes me happy because now I know that other people have felt the same way--and that gives me encouragement to maybe give it another shot sometime.
