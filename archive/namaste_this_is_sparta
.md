Think  your individuality is what makes you special, and that individuality determines how far you can go? Gym Jones--the gym apparently responsible for the meatfest in the movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG6FZZY9ciA">300</a>--says otherwise, snowflake:
<blockquote>
If you weren't given the gift you can't get the gift so the best you can do – if your goal is important – is work as hard as you possibly can, pay attention every hour of every day and then maybe, maybe if you've done enough and been smart enough you'll emerge from the muck of mediocrity to shine a bit brighter than you shone before. Then, upon reflection you might decide your goal is a bit more important so you'll start paying attention every minute of every hour of every day. You'll find people who are better than you and you'll take an empty cup when you meet them. Their example will destroy or inspire you and if it's the latter you may stay and learn. You might imitate, doing as they do because you've already accepted that you do not know best – if you did you'd be leading the group they were trying to join. Perhaps being exposed to their superior ability will drive you to work harder than you thought possible, or necessary. Maybe you'll overcome your self-imposed (or worse, society-imposed) limitations and shine even more brightly. Wow, you're getting it: positive reinforcement for hard work and suffering. So maybe you give your goal even more significance and you begin cutting away the ideas and the expectations and the people who you believe prevent you from achieving it. Now you become a real selfish prick, and you begin paying attention every second of every minute of every hour of every day, and you sustain your awareness for weeks and months at a time. You no longer think yourself a unique snowflake, you're a steel-edged blade shaped like a snowflake and you're spinning at warp speed. You're the biggest fish in the pond. You're a badass. Now you have options.</blockquote>

Interestingly, this physical fitness philosophy is surprisingly similar to aspects of Hindu principle. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, as India <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT8zcT7sbMk">has its own version of Gym Jones</a>, depending on your focus.

What would happen if everyone stopped focusing on differences, targeting instead the unattainable?
