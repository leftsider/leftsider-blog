I've been dreaming more vividly lately. I always consider dreams to be a measurement of your brain's activity. 

When I was young, I would have unbelievably vivid dreams. I can still remember two of them; one was a recurring nightmare at a pumpkin farm, while the other one was a glorious apparition where I lived in a two-story glass house and eventually turned into an all-powerful, albeit non-flaming, phoenix. 

As I pushed further into school, and particularly in that stage where coolness must be <em>exuded</em>, I feel like my dreaming diminished. I often had good dreams, but nothing so exciting; more often than not, I retold my good dreams from before rather than dream up anything new. I think this says a lot about this period of my life.

But they're back now, and I'd like to think that their intensity is in no small part to the content that I am putting into my subconscious. The new feature, however, is how involved my dreams have become with my conscious thought.  in my last dream, not only did I speak Japanese (poorly, over a meal with a grocer in Japan) but I actually mentioned items on my agenda for today in conversation. Talk about reinforcement!

Yes my last dream session was a doozy. I also attended a lovely wedding. Time passed while at the reception, and I watched the couple--newly attired--in a beautifully arranged renewal of vows. One room had been set up and was restricted from guests, looking inside, I saw a replica of their wedding cake sitting on what looked like a table in a cafeteria. My sense told me that this hidden room was reserved for them to remember where they first met/fell in love, and I was struck with emotion as the wave of their memories rushed into my mind. I cried at the sweetness of their love, to the extent that I was nearly drawn from the dream by the realization that I was almost crying into my pillow in the real world. 

Yes, this is the same dream where I sat and talked shop with the Japanese grocer over a freshly prepared meal, listened to a band not unlike the roots play inside a passing school bus, and ran to join a rap battle along side an unknown friend and Notorious B.I.G. Yes it was a wild for hours of sleep.

Fru loves to sleep. It is her default action when her choices have all been used. For me, sleeping (and eating for that matter) is not so much an activity as it is a method to keep the activities going. Thankfully I've dreams to keep the sleeping times just as exciting.
