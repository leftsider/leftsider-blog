Some of you may not know what I'm doing in the US. I've been here for two months, yet I don't think I've given any indication to my current occupations.

A while back I worked for a large non-profit organization for a few years. Started off as a temp, then contractual, and eventually landed a full-time spot. l was young and eager when I worked there last, and even took my own time off to work an event with a department other than my own. After working two 80+ hour weeks, I left an impression strong enough do be pursued by that department's director in February, nearly six years later. 

Leaving Asia behind, I arrived in Virginia on March 8. Two days later, I was still in Virginia, but I had been to Maryland, gotten our apartment keys, and taken a formal employment test. That Monday, the 13th, I was at work at 8am.

Coming back to work here has been an experience. All of the reasons I left in the first place (including my need to finish school) are still there, same as ever. Same people, same confusion; but did I mention I got a job before I even came back?

When I left before, I was working mostly with video production and satellite broadcasting. This time I'm dealing with print production and content side of event preparation. I've got two bosses, both of whom are fresh from other countries. They're eager to show their mettle, and I think they are a bit skeptical of me. After all, when I arrived the whole department knew me, top level employees come by to say hi, VPs greet me, and I'm not necessarily in the "I'm new so let me impress my boss" mode.

All of this calls for a very bumpy ride. Initially I was game, then I started looking for other options, but right now I'm tentatively sticking it out for a bit. If there's anything I'm known for in my working (besides always being known) is that I really come to work to solve problems and make things easier. There's a lot of work to be done in that regard, and I'm hoping it'll shape me up so that once the issues have been cleared I can move right on into autopilot and focus on my studies.

Yes, I haven't forgotten the studies. Currently signed up for ten hours this summer. I'm actually looking forward to it, as it may be my only opportunity to interact with new people and discover new, interesting things. I have little else to look forward to, as everything else seems to mandate looking back. 

*sigh*
