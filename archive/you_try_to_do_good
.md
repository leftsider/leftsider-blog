...and it comes back to bite you. This week I checked my bank account and found that my old job had paid me. Well, the 17th of December was my last physical day, followed by a week's vacation. I got paid just before we left, and when I got another paycheck, that seemed enough. This extra check was an apparent oversight.

Late last night I called the office, which apparently holds me in high regard, and talked with some old associates for a bit before dropping the news. After being transferred to the accounting department, I repeated my story and sat pensively through a long pause.

"....You are SO honest!" The accounting lady finally replied. "You could've just taken the money, and--let me check here--you would have continued getting paid, too." 

Well I was kinda proud by this point, but then she continued to investigate. After looking up my termination date, she concluded, "Actually, you got TWO extra checks." Apparently, my last day was halfway through a pay period, which meant that the other week of vacation filled the first check and there was no need for another payment--all the checks I received this month were extraneous.

This put me in a pickle, because most of the previous check was already gone. Taking both back now would leave me rubbing pennies until the end of the month. I explained to the accounting lady that I was a poor college student abroad with no real income so she was graceful enough to work with me on the earliest check. I'll probably pay in installments or something. 

So now, instead of just honestly returning money, I acquired a lender who I have to pay back. Great. Owing a couple grand was exactly how I wanted to wake up this morning.
