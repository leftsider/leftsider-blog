	This pic is from Fru's photostream, where you can see other pics of our vacation.<br />
<br />
Saturday morning Fru and I said goodbye to Tav and headed out to catch a water taxi back to mainland. We were on our way to Changuinola to catch a bus that went directly back to San Jose. You see, it was my great-grandmother's birthday, and I had yet to see her.<br />
<br />
We tried as best we could, but by the time we put bags down in our hotel there were only 45 minutes left of visitation hours at the center where she stays. I was more than a bit disappointed, but there's only so much that you can do, right?<br />
<br />
So instead I dropped the little gift I had brought for her at my cousin's house. Turns out I was able to see my cousin and partner in crime, Fernando, who turned up with his girlfriend and daughter (who didn't exist last time I saw them!). We had a good time talking, and I think I almost convinced him to come up and stay in DC sometime soon. ^^<br />
<br />
6am the next morning I was at the airport, with apparently every other tourist in a 100km radius, heading back to Newark. We bused back to Silver Spring and cabbed it home. When I woke up on Monday morning I knew I was home but didn't have a clue what I was supposed to do or what language I was supposed to be speaking (I had been studying japanese the night before). It took about 4 days before I finally caught up with myself.<br />
<br />
All in all, not the vacation I had planned, but a good vacation nonetheless. Tav spent another day in Bocas and then flew directly to San Jose to catch his flight home. When he reached LA, he sent a text message that said it all: "No mas Pura Vida. *sigh*"
