<blockquote>Two years ago, I dressed up as Theodore Roosevelt for Halloween, and my friend Emily dressed as Cuba. Together, we were "the Spanish-American War". We weren't trying to honor the man, the country, or U.S. interventionism. Rather, we were trying to let a bruised and hard-to-defend moment of American history have a rare moment as a costume.</blockquote>

With an opening paragraph like this, you either turn off immediately or turn the ol' intellect up a notch and get ready for a good one. I mean honestly, who dresses up for halloween as a war?

If I may (I mean, it's my blog, for pete's sake) I'd recommend the latter. Definitely a good read.
