BODY:
 After a sobering approximation of my fitness at a recent health fair, I've been really conscious about my weight, diet, and physical activity. I'm managed to dredge myself from the mattressed grave and get into the gym in the mornings again, and I've given myself a target deadline--my trip to Costa Rica at the end of March.

One problem still remains. I have no fuel to fire my workout. When I was younger, I would pour out my angst, my frustrations, my will to achieve into my workout and push myself to the next level. Nowadays, I realize that my life really must be pretty good, as all of those things are in short supply. 

The ultimate proof of this was evidenced today. I threw some weight on the bar for bench pressing. Roughly a hundred pounds, not a problem. For the next set, I wanted to push myself, so I added 50 pounds. Lifted the bar with ease, slowly descended....and at that point realized that I wasn't really interested in pushing that much weight back up.

As a fellow member came over and helped me lift the weight off my chest, I had a flashback of, say, ten years ago. A time when I weighed about 30 pounds less and regularly lifted about 30 pounds more. I used to tell my friends, who would nod in agreement, "It's just a matter of survival...every person should at least be able to bench his/her own weight." A deflated ego is a terrible thing to experience. 

The disturbing element for me is that I don't think that I was incapable of pushing that bar back up. I believe the energy required to do that is still inside me. So why can't I tap into it, even at a time of general emergency like that? It makes me wonder if I'd be able to do something if the moment demanded it. Moreover, the link between mind and body....would my brain do the same if placed under duress?
