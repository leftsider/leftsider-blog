<blockquote>The world's cities are getting taller â€“ and fast. Between 2001 and 2012, almost as many skyscrapers will be constructed as were built in the entire 20th century.</blockquote>

Makes sense to me. Why sprawl when you can climb? A recent conversation that I had with a friend, however, pointed out one drawback to my recent promotion of urban living; pollution. 

While I haven't any indication that pollution per person increases in an urban setting, it is more concentrated due to the density of the population. This is evidenced by the cloud of smog that is present over many major cities. He noted that even 20 years ago in New York if you left the window open you'd find a layer of dust/soot/something covering your household items. Tasty. 

What solutions do we have for pollution in highly concentrated areas? anyone know?
