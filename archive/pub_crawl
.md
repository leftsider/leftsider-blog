Last night I went on an impromptu pub crawl. Plans for dinner with some associates fell through, so I decided to pay a visit to a friend of mine who co-owns a bar. I hadn't seen him in a while, so I felt like it was a good opportunity to pay a visit.

Caught up with him, sat back, enjoyed my non-alcoholic cocktail (they know me well there) and enjoyed the environment. I found myself in conversation with a German-born Korean who teaches English here. We struck up a good rapport, and when he asked me to accompany him to another bar, I said, "why not?"

I'm interested in the nightlife scene because I made a map of downtown a while back that I've really been neglecting, mainly because I need to go out and find the places that are worth identifying. So when asked to check out another popular spot, I have to agree for purely academic purposes. heh.

Anway we went to a bar called Itaewon Crew Pub. This is amusing because the place in Seoul that is known for foreigners is called Itaewon. Sure enough, everyone here was expat or very expat-friendly. The music was all American rock and folk with a little hiphop thrown in for good measure. The area was laid out nicely and, except for a few odd quirks, made a pretty nice place.

I had a soda and played some pool with my new friend, Leo. He introduced me to some other foreigners and we struck up more interesting conversation.

Finally it was last call at ICP. Our two new associates, Chris and John, suggested we check out another bar called Commune. At this point, my plans for catching the last train home were long gone, so there was nothing to restrain me. Off we go.

Lonely Hearts Club Commune ("Commune" for short) was a basement bar that made me feel like I had just stepped out of Korea and into 1997 all over again. Kurt Cobain pictures on the walls, a guy on the mic singing barefoot to his acoustic guitar, and virtually no Koreans. Ok there were a few: The bartender, his friend who played busboy, and a handful who were either Gyopo or dating a foreigner. By that description, this was not a place I really wanted to be.

As it turns out, the barefoot strummer was a guy I met before who teaches English at Daegu Catholic University. I chatted with him for a bit after ordering a ginger ale and greeting the friends of my (now three) new associates. Then the bartender threw on an eclectic mix which included beach boys and van morrison as well as smashing pumpkins and chef(from South Park) as well as theivery corporation and portishead. I was quelled. Perhaps this wasn't a hippiefest after all.

Well after meeting a few more people, exchanging a few numbers and watching the crowds dwindle, it was time to move on. Chris and John called it a night, but Leo was still ready to go. We headed to Bubble, a happening nightclub, but I parted ways at the door. It was after 3am and my initial intention was to be home by 11.

While nervously overseeing my sleepy taxidriver's attentions, I thought about my night. It reminded me a lot of those days long ago when I used to slip out at night and just wander and explore. I've always said that I wanted to do that here, but I never have. There's always been some excuse to keep me--and now I see that perhaps being "kept" had created some unvalidated opinions in my mind, particulary toward the expat crowd.

Maybe I'll venture out again. I imagine that if I ever get a call from any of those people I met I'll head down again and see if last night's pleasant crawl was a unique thing. Or maybe I'll just make a night of it myself. We'll see.
