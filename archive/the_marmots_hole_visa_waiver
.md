I hesitated on commenting on this, for fear of flaming and rebuke. But then, when business is slow.....generate traffic one way or another....

I'm interested to see what happenes if this really does take place. Let's hope they don't adopt the reputation other asians I happen to know (namely, ones that start with "f" and end with "ilipino").
