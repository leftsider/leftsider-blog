If you've had a recent conversation with me....that narrows you down to about 3 people....you know I'm really passionate these days about giving opportunities to those less advantaged. I have a soft spot in my heart for those who don't even have the tools to dream.

That being said, this and the $100 computer really make me excited. And yes, the first commenter says what I really hope will happen. I can't wait to see some little illiterate einstein totally blow our minds away once he gets his hands on something new. 

Prolly crappy by my standard, but it's better than nothing. And that's a good place to start.
