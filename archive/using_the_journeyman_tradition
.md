Crunch time.

While I squirm, here's another something I wrote suggesting a solution to cultural sensitivity. My professor suggested that it might be publishable with some adjustments; I wonder if I'm ruining the chance by placing it here? 

<blockquote>On a bus, headed from Changuinola, Panama, to San Jose, Costa Rica, it became painfully aware why I don't care for American company when traveling abroad. A handful of U.S. youths sat behind my wife and I, chattering away about their spring break journey. Crossing the border into my mother's country, they recalled their stay in the small border town of Sixaola by renaming it "Sex in the wrong hole-a." Particularly distasteful, one of the ladies in the party loudly proclaimed, "I'd rather have unprotected sex with a dirty, unknown man than stay in that place again." I noted to my wife that this person was basically saying she would sell her body rather than live any life other than one of privilege. No doubt this privilege was funding her education, paid for their vacation, and would bail them out if anyone within earshot and less tolerant was as weary of their complaining as I.</blockquote>

EXTENDED BODY:
A week later, I read a passage from a Hans Christian Andersen tale that reminded me of that ordeal:

    "...what is far more advantageous abroad than all the preparations you can make at home, is said in a few words--give up all intercourse with your own country-people! Nowadays every one travels! Paris is not now further from us than Hamburg was some thirty years ago. When I was in Paris I found there sixteen or seventeen of my countrymen. O, how they kept together! Eleven of them dwelt in the same hotel: they drank coffee together, walked out together, went to the restaurateur's together, and took together half a bench in the theatre. That is the most foolish thing a person can do! I consider travelling useful for every one, from the prince to the travelling journeyman... The creative artist, the poet, the engineer, and the physician must travel... [but] those who cost the most generally are of the least use, and bring the country the least honor! I, thank God! paid for my journey myself, and am therefore free to speak my opinion!"(Andersen)

Paying for myself and the travels of my spouse, I echoed the sentiments of the fictional character Cousin Joachim. Would these students have been so ungrateful they were traveling individually? What if they had to work for their lodging? When they got home, would they utilize the events of their travels to enrich their daily lives and rituals? If not, the trip would largely be a waste. They could have saved a lot of money by visiting their closest beach.

Within our country's borders, teens and young adults struggle to find themselves and quantify their identity. In a society that increasingly smothers our children with unmerited praise, access to anything they desire and positive reinforcements for mediocre efforts, these struggling youths have little incentive to dig deeply and find their solution with determination and resolve. They become spoiled cretins that run to and fro on funds that they had no part in generating; wondering how great it is to travel when, in fact, they have not stepped one foot out of their bubble of security. The benefit of travel has been lost.

Have we turned our children over to themselves for development? Are we as a society, let alone parents, not responsible for building character in those to whom we hope to turn over the responsibility of a nation? If we are successful in getting our kids through 12 years of education, have we done enough?

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a mere 26.8% of the total population 25 and over has a bachelor's degree or higher. While this number is impressive when considering how many people worldwide are able to attend higher education, it is frightening when we realize that the remaining 74.2% have, at 25 or older, not completed any type of training or certification that would require them to broaden their perspective or spend time in a culture other than their own. By our own acceptance of these numbers, we reinforce the chances that three out of four encounters a non-American person has with an American will be one that perpetuates the stereotype of the arrogant, ignorant American. While it would be impossible to mandate college level educations for all, there are ways in which we can actively work to improve this current trend.

One of our greatest developmental tools in the battle against these stereotypes is independent travel. Such travel--where individuals are responsible for generating funding of their journeys while traveling--would encourage self-reliance, adaptation to unfamiliar culture, and a more realistic understanding of the boundaries of human capability. An acquaintance from high school saved her money to buy a ticket to Spain. Upon arrival, she spent a month working a variety of jobs to make the fare required to reach a friend's house in London. Working there for three months, she flew to the Washington D.C. area, where she stayed with a fellow classmate. When we visited with her, it was easy to see that a half year of travel had given her a sense of confidence and competency that we could not match. This small girl left big impressions in our minds as she parted for the next leg of the journey, which ultimately took over a year.

The experiences that we receive from our journeys are just as important as the ones we experience in the classroom. In an interview regarding the journeyman programs of certain European countries, human resources expert Hedley Malloch agreed. "Travel not only broadens the mind," he noted, "it expands the skills base, humanity and cultural awareness. It is travel, rather than manners, that makes the man." (Boucher)

In medieval times, a journeyman went from place to place looking for work from skilled artisans in the field which he hoped to master. There was no proven path for success; no arrangements were made beforehand for work or accommodations. Yet because he had acquired some level of proficiency, his position was superior and quite different from an apprenticeship, where an unskilled trainee worked for a specific amount of time under a specific master to gain the elements of the trade. Many men from all types of trades followed this time-honored tradition that crossed cultures, languages, and cultures; those men and women who still do participate in these traditions have talents that often outshine their peers.

Apprenticeship is not uncommon to the United States. In fact, many companies actively utilized in-house apprenticeships programs until the recession of the 1980's. Yet the wandering craftsman--a journeyman--is an idea that can only loosely be compared here to the availability of jobs for a union-affiliated craftsman, and it has never really caught on like it has in countries like France. Perhaps, as Malloch and others have, the concept is not one that is easily applicable to our culture (Boucher).

But it does have benefits that we so desperately need, benefits that are commonplace in almost every other area of the world. Madhu Singh's studies of work and learning in the informal economies of the third world showed that most participants in these economies gained their experience not from formal education, but from these types of informal, unsynchronized methods of training. These methods were catalysts for the enterprising elements essential for self-employment (Singh, p.602, 603).

Making this type of opportunity more common in America would help to refine and distinguish young administrators and leaders with a realistic, practical perspective. It also provides an impermanent workforce that can provide flexibility in many sectors of our country's more formalized economy. Even if focusing solely on the various cultures within our nation, we encourage the type of cultural awareness which builds networks that unite an often polarized nation. The outcomes of such experiences are sought after, as is seen in the marketability of those who have participated in City Year and other AmeriCorps initiatives. Expanding to neighboring countries could strengthen diplomatic ties and also give an edge to those who participate, as it has for those in Peace Corps.

In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Walton writes of the adventure which his travel expeditions have brought him, and adeptly explores the emotions and processes which brought him to the choices he made. For him, the journey itself was the experience from which there was something to gain, and the destination was simply a milestone to mark his progression. If we could instill this same passion for learning, understanding and gaining perspective in the youth of today, we could only improve our situation.

Not everyone can place their kids in private schools or send them on expensive overseas excursions. If my traveling companions in Central America were any indication, doing so wouldn't even bring us to the answer. With a renewed support for independent travel and study, however, we can develop the mentality of the overwhelming majority of our nation that has not had that experience through higher education. We can revive a sense of adventure and independence that has sat largely dormant since the era of continental exploration. In doing so, we take great strides in building a cultural awareness that leaves a greater reputation in our global society.
