<blockquote>Eight out of 10 Korean women over the age of 18 feel they need cosmetic surgery, and one out of two has undergone cosmetic surgery at least once, a survey has found.</blockquote>

We would joke casually about the dangers of having kids in Korea. If your kid turned out horribly ugly or completely different from you, you can blame it on you wife's plastic surgery. Chances are, you have no idea what she really looks like. 

I've heard horror stories about women being afraid to show their new husbands their faces without makeup, so this statistic (especially if it includes the eyelid modification) doesn't surprise me at all.
