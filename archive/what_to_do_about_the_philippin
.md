<blockquote>To me, the Philippines seems like the Haiti of Asia. All the foreign aid in the world won窶冲 solve its problems and the country seems to find itself in everlasting debt. The people haven窶冲 seemed to find the necessary empowerment needed to provoke a positive difference in their lives and the government enjoys its access to power at the expense of its citizens.

Can the country ever pull itself together and meet the potential I窶冦 sure it has? My personal opinion would be to revamp the government and get Glorio Arroyo out of office and someone else in her position through a fair, democratic election (which I don窶冲 believe Arroyo窶冱 re-election was).

I admit, I don窶冲 know a lot about the Philippines at all, mainly because my interest in the country is quite low. I know very, very little, in fact. But from what I can gather of it, nothing seems to change there and perhaps for that reason, it has a very dim light on my Asia radar. Those more informed, however are invited to educate me.</blockquote>

Being married to a Pinay-American, I think I was a little put off by this entry. I'm usually in agreement with Jodi (or at least willing to accept her POV) but I feel like this time it's completely subjective, un-researched and speculative--which is so unlike her usual writing. I don't however, feel I have the level of information to set the record straight. Hmm...new ethnographical study, anyone?
