BODY:
Today my father married his third wife. I mulled over the idea of not attending, but decided to go. As fate would have it, we ended up missing the ceremony completely. There were apparently no hard feelings, though, as followed the party to the reception before heading home.<br /><br />It's not easy to watch anyone marry a third spouse. You begin to wonder why they're trying again, what will they gain from yet another endeavor, and, especially, whether they've modified their selection criteria since the last time. It's harder still when it's your father, to whom you owe half of your genes directly (and the other specifically through his preference). You want to wish them good luck, but you'd rather investigate for a good reason.<br /><br />Perhaps that explains why today was the second time in my life that I've met the woman who now could technically petition to be called stepmother. The first time was over Thanksgiving, and I assume that is sometime near the beginning of their relationship; I have no idea. Honestly, last week I was asking my sister what her name was. Again. And it didn't help that I was told of the plan to marry about six weeks ago, and the ceremony was expedited--a month earlier than originally stated. By the time my MapQuest placed me at the church 30 minutes late, having missed the entirety of the ceremony, I couldn't muster any more suspicious confusion if I tried.<br />

EXTENDED BODY:
The trick, though, is to blame this all on my dad. Rather than chalk this up to the machinations of a secretive and conniving black widow who has it out for my father's blood, that is. Because honestly, who'd want to think that their father would hop into such deep level of relationship without even really working you into the equation? Despite my natural tendency to defend my father's logic, today I must look find him guilty of putting his family at a disadvantage.<br /><br />We now have the uphill battle of befriending someone who is already to be considered a part of us. We now must open our arms without abandon to a mere acquaintance--someone I've seen less than <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2008/04/abandoning-status.htm">my neighborhood panhandler</a>.We must do the work of <i>courting her</i> after the wedding.<br /><br />My work revolves around understanding experiences, so I embrace the opportunity to feel something new. Today, as my father makes post-honeymoon plans to jettison his possessions and move in with his new bride (address unknown), I certainly have something different to add to my collection of unique scenarios. <br /><br />Thanks dad, and best wishes to you and your beautiful bride.<br />
