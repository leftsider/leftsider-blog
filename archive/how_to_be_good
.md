But if you consider suicide violent death, then it evens out because Europeans are very likely to take violent action against themselves. So Americans want to take action, they say: I know how to fix your life. I'll kill you." Europeans say: "I know how to fix my life. I'll kill myself." When you take both, you find out that rate of violent death is the same in Europe and America."

Now that's a panel worth listening to. I think Negroponte's response is intriguing, but I also think it avoided the bigger issue in a way: is doing what we think is right equivalent to doing "good"? Does "good" always transcend cultural philosophies? If not, do we force our "good" upon others who may not see it as such?
