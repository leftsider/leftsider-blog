BODY:
Apologies for the unannounced hiatus, There were some things <em>I needed to do</em>:
<ul><li>test new publishing platforms</li><li>write for a few different publications</li><li>CLEP a class, register for a max semester load</li><li>discover a graduate program that seems perfect</li><li>tender my resignation from my current job, prepare for a freelance life</li></ul>

That's about all you need to know. The details will come out in subsequent posts.

Your "busy-body" mentality inspires me.

Glad to hear. Unfortunately the "busy-body" results seem somewhat elusive.
