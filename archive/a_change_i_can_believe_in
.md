In <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2009/02/managing-design-projects.htm">my post about the Adaptive Path conference</a> I made reference to my "failures and middling achievments." I'd like to be a little more specific.<br /><br />Since I <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2008/06/status-report.htm">started the new job</a>, I've been less successful than I had anticipated. I focused too much on defining myself outside of the shadow of my predecessor. I moved hastily to motivate people and create a third culture of design. I worked hardest at deadline times, waiting for launches to expose flaws that I could mend. In retrospect, these are all things that work well for a freelancer or sole proprietor--when you are the lead--but not at all useful when establishing the relationships that make a team.<br /><br />What team building requires is must more evolving than immediate; it starts at the familiar and smooths the transitions, and works were everyone feels most comfortable. I assumed that I would either have a team already versed in design or the jurisdiction to establish parameters, and with neither my work suffered dearly. Projects languished where there was an absence of collaboration, and all tasks were equally weighted--and equally demanded. <br /><i><br />Managing Design Projects</i> opened my eyes to my own shortcomings as much as it gave new ideas and strategies. Of particular note:<br /><ul><li>I was not as cognizant of personalities as they relate to team interaction. I must approach people in a way that they feel most comfortable.</li><li>I failed to create a protocol for task management, as well as a record of goals achieved. I seem to be totally busy, but have shown very little for it.</li><li>I've not made design and design research plain enough for non-inclined to see value. Without value, there is little incentive to maintain (I also never expected such an aversion to reading! wow!).</li></ul>But these are all things I can change. I'll just have to start a little deeper, a little slower, and, most likely, with a little less group enthusiasm to use as inertia. I look forward to actually opening the book they gave us, and really setting up a management program based on proven methods. If it's proven and within my power, it's something I can believe in. <br />
