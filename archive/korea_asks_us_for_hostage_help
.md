<blockquote>Relatives of the South Korean hostages in Afghanistan have made an emotional appeal to the US for help.

They visited the US embassy in Seoul on Wednesday, and were told their plea would be passed to Washington.</blockquote>

You know I love Korea like my right arm (I'm lefthanded), but please, U.S., <strong>don't do it.</strong> We have enough coals in the fire, we're doing damage control as it is, and an unsuccessful scenario would just give Koreans another thing to add to their U.S. gripe list. Heaven knows we don't need anything else added to that.
