<blockquote>I think the best thing you can do when you are starting out in your career is to become familiar with your natural, intuitive voice that tells you what is truth and what is crap. Passion is just an emotional byproduct of doing the right thing at the right time. Part of the struggle that peers of my generation face is that they thought they had to turn off their emotions to make it through the work day. Now they don't even know how they feel, and are walking zombies ready to explode at any minute.

There is no need to choose a "career path" that is a series of ever-ascending job titles and salary levels. That model is dead for your generation.</blockquote>

I am so feeling this.
