Satan stole my writing instrument. 

It's the closest thing to a reasonable excuse I have for not writing. I told myself I'd do it later, or that the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/07549468188388345490">topic I was currently ruminating</a> wasn't pertinent. A few times I actually sat down to write it and either lost my train of thought or became distracted. All part of an intricate plot  of the evil one.

As a result, I'm here creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-story">backstory</a> when I should be telling you exactly what I'm thinking. 

There has been considerable conversation these days about storytelling--how rich and vibrant a vehicle it is, how much it shows culture, how <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/revivinganorexicwebwriting">sorely it is needed</a> in developing the web and technology in general, let alone cultural understanding outside of these areas. But there are more reasons, the greatest in my book being that not telling the story <a href="http://bjfogg.typepad.com/bj_foggs_weblog/2005/11/technology_kill.html">inhibits communication</a>. Your perspective is lost, and, simultaneously, others make assumptions to fill the space where your input could have created a more definite stance. 

All of this to say that the experience, and those related to it, suffer. As I am now completely about experiences, there is no excuse for this type of interactive handicap.
