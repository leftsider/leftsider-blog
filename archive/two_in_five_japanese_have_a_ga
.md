I wonder if there are any surveys regarding American gardening tendencies, especially <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/balcony.htm">in urban areas</a>. 

I've never really been a particularly meticulous gardener, even when I did live in the country. I do, however, feel there is something therapeutic about caring for plants. Whenever I get one, I tend to treat it as if it were my own flesh and blood, which may be why I usually don't purchase them for myself.

This month, however, I did buy a plant from a friend who grows Indian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine">jasmine</a>. She took some cuttings, tended them until they took root, and then gave it to me. It really does look just like some cuttings stuck in dirt right now, but I'm hoping to see some growth eventually. Another thing for me to pine over. 

This officially brings our family plants to four; my jasmine and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390397889/in/set-72157594536058993/">my tropical fern</a> I inherited from my in-laws, and Fru's two bonsai trees; one is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390399179/in/set-72157594536058993/">indoors</a> and one is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390406552/in/set-72157594536058993/">on the patio</a>.
