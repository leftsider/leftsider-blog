Oh Mr Yoo... how you make the music I love. Yoo Hee Yeol, also known in the Korean music world as TOY, is definitely my favorite Korean artist. He's inching his way closer to my all time fav as well.

What was wrong with the video? Admittedly, it's a lot different from the usual video you'd find in Korea... but I thought it was sweet in a sad way.
