<blockquote>Within minutes an email arrived from a friend in San Francisco asking if I was doing ok and a friend in France posted the news on his Twitter feed (photo above), which has nearly 800 readers. Colleagues discussed the situation without me knowing about it.

Suddenly I found myself explaining to people spanning nine timezones that we are, in fact, still getting married. Donâ€™t always believe what Facebook tells you.</blockquote>
