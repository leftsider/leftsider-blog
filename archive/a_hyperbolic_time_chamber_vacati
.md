After a lot of interesting interactions, I've really craved for the time to sit down, think, and map out what's next for me, for Leftsider, and for the world. Starting today, I'm taking off for a week, and my office is closed the following week, so I've got a nice long holiday opportunity to do just that.

There's so much, though, to cover! So yesterday I brought my second haul of books home and readied myself for the *Hyperbolic Time Chamber Vacation.*

The **Hyperbolic Time Chamber** is a bit of *deus ex machina* used by the writers of the Dragonball Z animation series. A minute in the chamber felt as if it were six hours; as such, one day in the chamber would allow for a year of training. The protagonists, faced with a vastly stronger opponent and very little time, somehow stumbled upon the knowledge of the "room of spirit and time" (translated to hyperbolic time chamber in the english translation) and travelled to it for a week's worth of preparation.

I've not yet figured out how to make a hyperbolic time chamber of my own, but during this holiday I'm going to squeeze as much reading, exercise, and contemplation in as his humanly possible. I'm not travelling anywhere. I'm avoiding calls. I intend to delve deep and come back revived. 

After having a nice conversation with [@stuyparker](http://twitter.com/stuyparker), I've been inspired to write daily. I'm hoping to use my HTCV as a springboard for this habit. Let's see how it goes.
