One thing I think that they are forgetting is that all Korean carriers give free incoming calls. All day long. That's a feature that, as I'm aware, only Nextel has ever offered.

As a result, a person on a 380-minute plan in Korea may very well need a 600-to-1000 minute plan in the US to keep from going over. And, making that comparison, the prices might be more similar.
