I'm not sure where people come up with the crap they speak. 

Right now, An editor of a magazine is sitting in the office of my magazine's editor.....he's trying to argue a point. I'm listening to his booming voice and I hear him say:

<blockquote>"Study after study shows that the workweek is longer in the United States than any other place in the world"</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/lab_hou_wor-labor-hours-worked">Bull-loney</a>. When I think of how much our <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/lab_wor_tim_mor_tha_40_hou-time-more-than-40-hours">friends in Japan work</a>, usually with no overtime....what a load of croc. How can you be an editor and say unfounded information, even if it is off the record. I don't even disagree with what he's saying, but that's horrible. Did he just make that up or something?
