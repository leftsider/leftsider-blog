I've been having this conversation with a few people; Is the Mac Mini as innocent as it seems? Most of my hardcore 'puter users are pretty keen on the Mini adn give it praise. Then there are the avid PC users who nearly fall over talking about how lame it is, an how no one using PC would switch when they'd have to buy a mouse, keyboard, and monitor (Question: what's wrong with the ones they <em>already have</em>?). I was almost ready to buy one myself as a solution to a problem I've been trying to solve--an external drive that could be connected directly to our router--so our laptops stayed wireless.

I think that is exactly where the Mac Mini fits in and really does its damage; it's not a one-stop computer solution; rather, it's makes itself an important component to a working equation--and at a incredibly decent price.

Mac Mini Auto--wirelessly uploading from my home computer? Now I need a garage....
