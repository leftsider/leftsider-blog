Little late on the offerings this week due to a lot of new developments. Hope to share soon. In the meantime....check out these interesting web tidbits:
<a href="http://seoul.craigslist.org/about/best/wdc/57138164.html">
Rave: I love you, Average Boyfriend</a>.
It's about time someone gave their man some props. That's why men don't treat you nice because all you know how to do is complain. *ahem* Glad I have a woman that appreciates me too.
<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0224_050224_sleep.html">U.S. Racking up Huge "Sleep Debt"</a>
Yeah I've definitely got a big sleep debt. I'm just waiting for the sleep mafia to come and break my sleep legs or take a sleep finger or something--cause there's no way I can make it up.
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/moxxxxxie/39650.html">Electronics Games Creationism</a>
The things people think up when that have nothing better to do. The only thing worse is that I'm the one who dredges the internet and finds them. =o[
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/03/03/samsung/index.php?lsrc=mcrss-0305">Samsung 19-inch LCD works as monitor, TV, FM radio</a>
Samsung is rockin' the mics these days and they just dropped this sweetie recently. Only thing it can't do is drive me to the mall. I don't have a car.
<a href="http://mobilelife.twoday.net/stories/565062/#trackbacks">Samsung SCH-V770 7-megapixel cameraphone</a>
Did I mention that Samsung is rocking the mic these days? It's a phone. It's primary function is to call people. It has a 7-megapixel camera with an attachable lens that looks like a trumpet mute. Man I need one like yesterday.

That's it for now...guess I'll head to bed.
