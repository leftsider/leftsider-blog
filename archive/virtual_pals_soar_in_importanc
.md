<blockquote>A survey found 43% of online networkers from the US felt "as strongly" about their web community as they did about their real-world friends.

It also revealed net-users had made an average of 4.6 virtual pals this year.</blockquote>

I'm not surprised. It would seem that I do make more online acquaintances than real-world ones, but that's largely because the internet is my primary recreational outlet. 

I remember my first real online friend. I met her in a MUsh (remember those?) and for some strange reason we chatted it up. In the first conversation she asked me, "Are you gay???" which was not so shocking considering our first conversation largely revolved around musicals. We said a lot of silly things and that was that.

We got to a point with the silly conversations that we basically roamed the MUsh as a duo. Talked increasingly about more serious, real-world stuff as well. Ultimately, we talked at least every weekday, no exceptions. When I made my very first blog, I asked her to collab with me and we did so for quite a while.

Ultimately she went off to do the LiveJournal thing and I incorporated the blog format in my personal site, creating what is now leftsider. We kept in touch for years; she frantically contacted me to see if I was ok during 9/11(I was); I spent hours and hours lending an ear and opinion on rocky relationships (which ultimately turned out better than I predicted, apparently). I don't really keep in touch now, but I do drop in and see what's new on <a href="http://www.winstonlf.com/">her site</a> periodically.

Online relationships have often been touted as a pure form. There is only the mind to understand; peers, appearance, and socio-cultural differences are largely made irrelevant. What can we learn from online relationships that can be translated into our real-world relations? Is there anything that should be added to our online relationships to make them more relevant and publically viable?
