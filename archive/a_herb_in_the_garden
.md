There are several other things [besides admiration for the queen](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/08/village-and-queen.html) which he planted in my head while there--the first of which is a curiosity for home gardening.

I grew up in the country and my father had a rather large garden. It eventually just became a large strawberry patch and, ultimately, a half-court space for a basketball hoop I received after finishing 8th grade. Since then, I've never even thought of gardening--though I have consistently had a plant or two in the house over the last decade.

My first full day in, Daryl had me over for lunch with his family. A cute house they recently moved into, they'd done some extensive gardening in the backyard. Of particular interest to me was a little box of herbs and leafy things from which we picked ingredients for salad. I thought to myself, "I should do this on my little balcony!"

So I started hunting up information to learn how to [grow my own salad](http://www.growit.umd.edu/Salad%20Tables%20and%20Salad%20Boxes/index.cfm). Also, I'm thinking of [seasonal plants and crops](http://containergardening.about.com/od/containersyearround/tp/Fall_Plants.htm) to potentially make this a year-round activity.

I know it's unlikely that I'll be able to grow enough really replace grocery produce, but perhaps it will lead to an interesting activity that will only expand--perhaps to a place with a bigger balcony?
