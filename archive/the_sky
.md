I'm not sure when it became such a controlling part of my life; I imagine back when I was talking a lot of philosophy and world religion classes. </p>

<p>The sky is the biggest thing we know--if you can even call it a thing. It basically is everything that we are not; above us and the clouds and the planes and satellites. It's beyond the stars. There's nowhere you can be and not take a clear view up and see sky.</p>

<p>The moment you try to imagine the vastness of the sky, you are immediately and acutely aware of the finiteness of <em>you</em>. While its immeasurability removes any hope of escaping it, consider how far you would have to go just to take a point of sky directly above you and send it below the horizon. As a morning sun in Central Park can easily be a sunset in Kowloon, two people so far apart can be sharing the same bit of sky.</p>

<p>Why does this impact me so?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>I am reminded that there are things bigger than me.</strong> Things that must squint to look down and see all the places I've been and things I've done. There are things I will never impact, and things that may never be impressed by my efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I am reminded that I'm oblivious.</strong> I barely know everything that's happening in my life, let alone all the lives under the same sky I see. Half the time I don't even notice <em>the sky itself</em>--the biggest thing I know. How could I possibly recognize subtleties when I've overlooked the obvious?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My mountains become mole hills.</strong> Considering the first two, it's hard to find something in my life big enough to make a blip on humanity's radar, let alone all existence. The moment I want to complain I must admit that under this sky someone else has a greater right. It doesn't make me feel better, but it does reduce my moaning and increase my gratitude.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I am warned of the danger in self.</strong> It is looking to self and its issues that allows my worries, wishes and concerns to block out the existence of everything around me--even the sky itself. By looking only at my needs and feelings I disconnect with humanity and magnify my problems and their respective emotions. The wise Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, Confucianist or Daoist knows the potential danger in self-led pursuits [<a href="http://bit.ly/b8uUCg">link</a>].</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So forgive the occasional <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/18131876899">emo-sounding tweet</a> regarding the sky. I am a guy with self-doubt, uncertainty and personal frustrations, but when I look away from my details and up to the sky I get a reminder of my real objectives: to live, to learn, to share and to appreciate.</p>
