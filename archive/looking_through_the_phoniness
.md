I had one pair's plastic lenses taken out and replaced with tinted glass, changing them to sunglasses; the others stayed as is.</p>

<p><b>That's right, none of these glasses are perscription; all are completely cosmetic.</b></p>

<p>I first started wearing fake glasses when I lived in Korea. <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/09/double-placebo.html">I've talked about this before.</a></p>

<p>This time around I felt a lot less concerned about them <em>appearing real</em>. These glasses are straight up ridiculous, and I know it. As soon as someone new mentions them, I mention they're fake. Why? I guess I'm comfortable with being phony.</p>

<p>Admit it--there are so many things we do that are completely and truly hollow fronts to portray something that we are not. We put on <s>nooses</s> ties, we user our blinker when a cop is nearby, we call out ideologies and mantras on twitter and like things we don't care about on facebook.</p>

<p>Maybe I've taken influence from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Watchmen#The_Comedian_.28Edward_Morgan_Blake.29">The Comedian</a>, who saw life's hypocrisy and wore it out for all to see. Perhaps I've just become more confident in self independent of appearance. At any rate, I'm wearing my phoniness on my sleeve.</p><p>And by "sleeve" I mean my face.</p>
