If there's one thing I've noticed around Korea, it's bad english. It's amazing how so many people can be <a href="http://www.greatreporter.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=359">so upset</a> about <a href="http://ahssa.blogspot.com/2005/03/beware-of-hogwons-in-korea.html">foreign english teachers</a>; it would seem that <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/6070533/in/set-129942/">no one has ever met one</a>.

Take the <a href="http://www.daegusubway.co.kr/english/management/index.html">Daegu Metropolitan Subway Corporation</a>, for example:

<blockquote><img alt="safetysecond.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/safetysecond.jpg" width="162" height="180" /></blockquote>

Ok, maybe that one was a little harder to catch, but I chuckled as soon as I saw it. Perhaps only a fluent speaker would notice that one.

I discussed with a few people my dream to create my own position in Korean government: Official Proofreader for the Nation. With my help, and the coordinated efforts of my department, we could eliminate many of the reasons that English in Korea is hilariously trivialized--both by foreigners and natives.

The resounding response, however, is that Koreans really don't care if it's correct, as long as it looks good. And that, friends, sums up the whole situation quite nicely.

For that I have some nice examples on my flickr page in the funny's set (not that I'm perfect, by no means, but it's still funny to see it on official signs, etc. :-)
