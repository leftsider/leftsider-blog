Every morning when I drop Fru off at work, she turns and gives me a kiss. I'm not sure if this is usual fare for the married set, but it's pretty routine for her. If it were up to her, every time that she left me for any length of time she'd signify it with a kiss. <br /><br />This, to me, is the absolute worst.<br /><br />My feeling is that a kiss is not a greeting, or a farewell, or a
tradition. It is simply a sign of affection. Affection does not show at
the same time each day or with unerring recur. Affection happens at
unique moments of the day when something inside you is gladdened by
their presence; when you thank them for that feeling with a kiss, it
may almost seem spontaneous.<br /><br />At night when I go to bed, I plant
a kiss on Fru's arm. Then I think about her, and I do it again. I
repeat this process until I'm able to give her a kiss that is a total
act of appreciation; a sincere token of my affection. <br /><br />That's
what a kiss should be to me. It's hard to explain, however, to someone
who thinks otherwise. How can you tell someone to only kiss you without
pretense and as randomly as possible?<br /><br />But think about your
favorite kiss... what can you remember about it? Do you remember it
happening? Chances are it was either something that came out of the
blue, or one that was meant to happen as the two of you were full of
affection for each other. It was not attached to an event or time, most
likely, though there may be some exceptions like a wedding day or New
Year's Eve. Even in these exceptions, though, the time or event took a
second place to the intensity of the moment.<br /><br />If people gave kisses their appropriate value, I think we could all enjoy them a little more.<br /><br /> <br />
