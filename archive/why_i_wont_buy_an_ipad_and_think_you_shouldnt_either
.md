BODY:
>> *If you want to live in the creative universe where anyone with a cool idea can make it and give it to you to run on your hardware, the iPad isn't for you.*

>> *If you want to live in the fair world where you get to keep (or give away) the stuff you buy, the iPad isn't for you.*

>> *If you want to write code for a platform where the only thing that determines whether you're going to succeed with it is whether your audience loves it, the iPad isn't for you.*

Interesting point of view from Cory Doctorow of Boing Boing. I'm inclined to agree with him but will reserve my opinion until I finish reading the rebuttal that pointed me to the article.
