I've been a married man for about 10 months now, and I'm happy to say that it's been positive all around. Sure there are somethings that take getting used to, but I can't think of one thing that was better off as a bachelor.

I'm thankful for my wife, and I think that there are a lot of reasons that God put her in my life. One of the biggest ones is that my love and respect for her has helped me to clean up my act around women. I was born a charmer, but was trained a wolf. Spending time with Fru has made me more of a gentleman and less of a dog.

But I am still a dog. I am a base, carnal, selfish wisp of a man--albeit on the road to wellness. For this reason, I've decided to write this letter to the women of the world.

<blockquote>Women of the world,

Hi there! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak to all of you directly; it's an honor and a privilege as some of you know that women quite possibly could be my biggest fascination. 

Since I was a boy, I've always looked in awe at that which is a woman. Curiosity and intrigue often got the better of me, leaving me in more predicaments than I care to share. Yet the mystery of you lingers on; still somehow linked to me in a way that cannot be severed.

Since you now know this, I'm gonna ask that you help me out in being the guy I want to be--and I'm sure that you all would generally like me to be. One who doesn't step on your feelings and make your existence miserable all for a notch on his belt or a temporary bliss. One who is all the things in that crappy Edwin McCain song you all love...without being crappy.

So there are some things you need to take in consideration as you continue to exist. Please don't think of these as rules for all men but rather recommendations from one. Okay, in no particular order:

<strong>I'm telling you I'm married, work with me.</strong> I'm being honest and upfront; I know this is a good trait in a man but I'm no longer on the market. Don't tell me that I don't look married or ask why I'm not wearing a ring or otherwise inquire to the status of my relationship. If I was the Hoover Dam would you pick and prod till I break? Okay then. In both cases, the moment I break is the moment I'm a disappointment to you.
Also, don't tell me my wife is lucky or you're jealous (or even worse, you don't care) or anything else that is going to make my head swell. When my head swells there's a lot of pressure on my brain. For some reason this pressure trggers a failsafe which diverts thinking to the groin area. It's not the best auxillary HQ; it's mainly concerned with self-preservation. Just convert all compliments into "Oh, that's sweet. Congratulations." In fact, at this point that's the only failproof comment, so be aware.

<strong>I'm married, not dead.</strong> A woman will wake up and spend over an hour preparing her face and hair. She puts on an outfit that makes her stunning. She poses and positions herself to look attractive. Even if she doesn't want men to approach her, subconsciously she wants all who see her--men and women--to consider her attractive.
Well if you're my type I will. And I will look, because I'm human. And if I'm with my wife I'll then have to see her looking at me looking at you...and try not to feel like a heel. This is why most come to women hate the guts of their partner at least once in their relationship. The problem is that there's nothing we can do about it, but there is something you can. I'm not gonna prescribe a dress code; I'm just gonna let you be a little more responsible in that area.

<strong>For crying out loud, don't be shy.</strong> Ok, this one is my problem, but you gotta help a brother out. I'm attracted to things shy and othwerwise unattainable. If I see you, and you see me, and you smile and look away...somewhere deep in the vast nothingness of my brain a little switch is thrown. <strong>GAME ON</strong>. Now I've tried to curb this and I think I've done a decent job, but as a domesticated predatory animal I still have innate urges that I am working on.
Best way to help me that? Just come up and say hello. I'm a friendly guy, and, especially if you know me and my marital classification, there's no reason for the doe eyes and bashfulness. It's cute, but cute kills.

Thank you for you time and attention. I will never ask you to be less beautiful, complex, and sophisticated. I will never ask you to change who you are. I appreciate and admire you; tall, fat, beautiful, short, ugly and thin. I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. Best wishes. </blockquote>
