SubEthaEdit is targeted at developers who embrace agile programming methods, specifically the pair-programming facet of eXtreme Programming.  The idea is that keeping maintainable source code requires a lot of peer review.  And instead of having periodic developer meetings reviewing changes made by the entire team since the last meeting, programmers are paired off and they write code, read each other's code, and talk about code together.  Thus, peer review happens all the time as the code is being written.  A collaborative editor like SubEthaEdit lets programmers that aren't physically in the same location practice pair-programming.
