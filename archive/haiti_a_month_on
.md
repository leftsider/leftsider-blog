BODY:
Saying "I told you so" doesn't make the tremendous drop in Haiti coverage any less depressing. I'm appreciative that there are still many relief efforts and humanitarian aid providers on the scene, yet I cringe at the thought that **Haiti was in our prayers only as long as it was before our eyes.**

With the torrential storm season fast approaching, and *tens of thousands still living outside*, I fear the worst is not yet over for this impoverished nation.
