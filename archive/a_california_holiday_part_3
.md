<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	We were fortunate to find San Francisco in exceptionally bright and clear weather as we made our way out of our food-filled abode and started to explore. Being my first trip to the west coast, I was particularly interested in the terrain, which proved itself to be quite diverse. <br />
<br />
In addition to remote locations (like here at the back of the bay) we also hit the usual locations like the Golden Gate Bridge, SF MOMA, Embarcadero, the Japanese Tea  Garden, and Chinatown, among other sights. This took up about two days.
