BODY:
When I was young I was a member of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinders_(Seventh-day_Adventist)">Pathfinders</a>, a youth activity program that is directed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. My parents were involved in running the program, so even before I was old enough to participate (Pathfinders are generally aged 10-15) I was attending workshops, camping and enjoying the program.

A lot of the direction and the instruction I remember of my youth came from that period of my life. Even now I remember the Pathfinder pledge and law as if I still recited it regularly:

**The Pathfinder Pledge:**

> By the grace of God
> I will be pure, kind, and true
> I will keep the Pathfinder Law
> I will be a servant of God and a friend to man.

**The Pathfinder Law is for me to:**

* Keep the Morning Watch
* Do my honest part
* Care for my body
* Keep a level eye
* Be courteous and obedient
* Walk softly in the sanctuary
* Keep a song in my heart, and
* Go on God's errands

I feel very fortunate to have embedded such earnest, uncomplicated life goals at such a young age. Decades later, I can see the pattern these credos have placed on my actions and decision-making as an adult. 

There's a significant chance I'll take some (or all) of these concepts and expound on them individually. Even so, what early developmental elements do you see guiding the way you live and operate today?
