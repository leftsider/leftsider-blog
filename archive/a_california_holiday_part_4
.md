	After a day with friends in Oakland, Fru and I headed down to Southern California. <br />
<br />
Originally, the plan was to take the senic Pacific Coast Highway down and enjoy the view. But since we anticipated a good bit of congestion on a sunny Sunday drive (and not impervious to the fact that we can never seem to make a departure time when on holiday), we decided to take the "direct route" of driving the 5 down to LA. <br />
<br />
As I've never been to a desert or seen hills so friggin' big, this was just as scenic as anything I had expected. Amazing drive; one to preface the PCH trip on the way back up.
