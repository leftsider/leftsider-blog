Today I ate lunch with a friend at a chinese resturaunt I've only been to previously with Joey. At the end of the meal, we received our complimentary fortune cookies and the bill. I always open my fortune cookie, and today I was met by this phrase:

<center> The only good is knowledge
and the only evil ignorance</center>

My brain is mush most of the time now due to my reintroduction to cubicle life, so I pocketed the slip of paper for later. Now, looking it at it, I'm still no more sure than I was at first glance.

Although it's hard to actually quantify, it could be said that most evil exists as a result of ignorance. If a sucker wasn't born every minute, a lot of opportunities for evil would cease to exist. In that sense, knowledge would prevent evil as much as it would prevent ignorance. In addition, we could probably eliminate the section of evil done "because they didn't know any better."

But I still hesitate to confirm the other half, that knowledge is the only good. What about kindess, love, and, well, innocence? are these things not good? can these things not exist without knowledge? 

Perhaps a clearer and more valid interpretation would be that knowledge exposes the good, while ignorance begets evil. Still not completely true, but one could argue that good would never be discovered without a knowledge of what good actually is. Conversely, even evil things seem good to unknowing eyes.

It's good to find something to mull over like this (and no, I'm not done mulling). With the exception of V for Vendetta, this might be the only thing I've found in the US sofar that really has requested my thought. Speaking of which, I started back on the korean study and my brain zaps out faster than ever these days. Help me stay in mental vigor; what's your take on my fortune cookie?
