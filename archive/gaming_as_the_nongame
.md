<blockquote>Kabu カブ means "stock" and tore トレ is short for "trade." I bought this game for the DS out of curiousity. It's an interactive tutorial about how to do online stock trading put out by Konami. When I bought the game they gave me this net trading beginner's guide by Zai magazine and a form to sign up for an account at Monex Securities. In Japan, a great part of the DS lite's success is the huge number of non-gaming adults buying them to play educational games.</blockquote>

Gaming is often vilified, and <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/08/cabelname_the_state_of_america.htm">sometimes for good reason</a>. Yet <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/12/tv_vs_video_games.htm">I've recently postulated</a> that perhaps there is more to gaming than just pushing buttons.

Nintendo seems to be most keen to this. One of the reasons that I've really been excited about Nintendo recently is that it seems that they have started to <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/01/on-brain-training.html">redefine what it means to "game."</a> (previously <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/01/cabelname_on_brain_training_if.htm">noted</a>)

All of a sudden people are excited about games again. With the Wii's new controller <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U78ylX3hlvI&NR">it's hard to find gamers seated</a>, which kills the primary point of contention about video games--lethargy. A video game now can teach you, train you, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDzbDGtEC58">get you moving</a>.

While I'm not an avid gamer, I'm really intrigued by this new direction and am eager to explor the potential for social and intellectual stimulus in an area that desperately needs it.
