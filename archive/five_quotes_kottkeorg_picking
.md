Picking up the meme from Kottke's explanation, here are my five:
<ul><li>To believe in God or in a guiding force because someone tells you to is the height of stupidity. We are given senses to receive our information within. With our own eyes we see, and with our own skin we feel. With our intelligence, it is intended that we understand. But each person must puzzle it out for himself or herself.(Sophy Burnham)</li>

<li>Good teaching is one-fourth preparation and three-fourths theater.(Gail Godwin)</li>

<li>Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.(E. F. Schumacher)</li>

<li>Never try to tell everything you know. It may take too short a time.(Norman Ford)</li>

<li>Comedy is simply a funny way of being serious.(Peter Ustinov)</li>
