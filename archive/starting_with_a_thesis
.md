BODY:
Instead of just talking about anime yesterday, I should have explained a little more of what I've been thinking about. I'm still working out specific nomenclature, but I hope my premise still makes sense.

I'm going to be examining, among other things, the cost and benefit of society's shift from monolithic tp modular systems of organization--the organization of information, of people, and of resources. I'll be frank and honest: a lot of this concept has been provoked by reading/listening to Clay Shirky, Adam Greenfield, and Jan Chipchase while being challenged by the non-theoretical applications of people like Anil Dash, Ev Williams and Jeffrey Veen. I'll be pointing pretty heavily to these sources at first, but I hope to expand to new competent sources of information as a result of my research. 

All said and done, my intention is to analyze and evaluate this burgeoning area to the extent that I can competently present and consult on the impact this will have for society and, occupationally, for existing organizations. I'd love to do this for my current organization, but ultimately at some point I'd really enjoy finding new cases for application of the principles I discover. 

If you have any information you think may be relevant to this study, feel free to share.
