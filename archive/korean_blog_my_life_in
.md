Ok it's not my life but it's a great website that will be ending soon. Such creative writing; I'm sad to see such a funny blog come to an end but I guess <a href="http://hype.non-standard.net/track/57573">everyone has a summer</a>. 

Just scroll down and read some of the earlier posts and you'll see why this guy's un-navigable, feed-less, plain ol' blog is so darn popular among the korea folks.
