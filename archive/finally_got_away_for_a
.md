Finally got away for a few days, and I think that I'm feeling better for it. A chance to not think about class requirements, work projects, friend issues, etc. I highly recommend it.

Besides seeing Ronaldinho play live and watching a great game in Yankee Stadium in the same short respite (as if that isn't great enough!), I also tried to get some time in for thought. One thing I thought about--the puprose for this post--was how much I really prefer "the District" to "the Big Apple."

After living in Daegu, quite possibly the most urban living situation of my life, Fru and I felt real withdrawal moving back to the comparatively rural lifestyle of east coast suburbia. While we still had alternative modes of transportation and a bevy of interesting things to see and do, The bus was too infrequent, the train was to far, and the cabs were too expensive. Further, our friends now were less interested in joining us on excursions, particularly ones that involved said public transportation.

For this reason, along with others, I've actually wondered recently if I'd enjoy living in New York City better. I've never thought about living in NYC seriously; not that I dislike it, just that it seems like a nice place to visit--not to live in. Yet now, as I'm looking to be more aptly stimulated, could New York be a better fit?

It's the city that never sleeps; the most recognized American city in the world. I spent the past four days there and it's all true. The best pizza in the world. Style and attitude abound. But I felt that there was a tremendous burden to maintain this symbolism of cool, to a point that is can really smother pure, innocent and uninhibited growth and creativity. I think that DC, being a small city that only recently started being hip, has a real clean creativity about it. There are a lot of people who want it to be a New York, or a Miami, or a Chicago; but it is what it is, and that's what makes it uniquely enjoyable. This is something that I said about Daegu as well, when comparing it to Seoul.

Probably the biggest thing that I discovered during this trip that I hadn't realized before is that I find DCers much more attractive than New Yorkers. I was shocked by this, as both are very well blended culturally. New Yorkers edge us out on style, but just general good looks goes to DC. I know this is not an objective category, but it really is important that if you must put up with attitude, at least there is something visually rewarding. heh.

One area I haven't really been able to quantify is also an area I haven't been able to correctly name. It involves the ease at which a person can think progressively, envision possibilities, and find a community of people interested similarly in looking down that road (although possibly from different perspectives. I haven't run into that kind of person in NY, but I think that may be because I'm usually with family when I'm up there....not with colleagues and associates. I think that these might be evenly matched, but I'd like to be more knowledgeable about  that whole thing.

So I arrived home today, and I was glad to be back. I definitely would rather live in the District. New York will always hold a special stage that DC cannot hope to aspire to, but I'll still be content just to visit.
