This weekend we were heading downtown to meet with some family from out of town. As we sat at a stop light, I noticed a car ahead that had an arm sticking out of the window....with a hand clutching a cellphone.

At first I thought that they were passing the phone to another car or something, but instead of passing it over, the hand raised it up, shook it around for about 5 seconds, and then pulled it back in the car.

Segue. Where do were learn how to use our mobile phones? We see people with them, the store offers them, and we buy them.  But do we actually know how and why they operate the way they do? 

When we passed the car, the woman was chatting amicably on her phone. My guess? Her understanding of how cellphones worked lead her to feel that by putting the phone in a higher, clearer area and shaking it around a bit she could "catch" some improved reception.  I chuckled at this, but how many things do we do that we have no proven basis for? Hmmm...
