BODY:
The story playing in my head is that you've got quite a bit going on, and those things are going pretty well. 

Most of those things are new things; things you've worked hard to realize or that have come about in their own way--but all in the years since we last saw each other. 

The story playing for me shows you unsure that you want to bother reconciling a casual acquaintance from yesterday with the realities of your now. But you're not a jerk so it feels wrong to not respond when a random leftsider appears. 

I totally connect with that story--I made it up after all--so most of me wants to let you be, not be a pest. But a slice of me says new Austin [redacted] might be an awesome and inspiring presence to two randos kicking off their own new Austin thing.
