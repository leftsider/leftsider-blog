BODY:
It's not that I fall in love too easily, because I'm not falling in love with people, but that looking at someone long enough will yield something I find admirable, novel or incorrigibly cute. 

I consider this a virtue, not a flaw. Yet perhaps my greatest foundational dissonance arises from this facet of my being: I live--half expecting, half hoping--for others to see me and find me charming, novel, or noteworthy. Perhaps when I was younger, when youth is its own attractor, this worked--certainly it brought me to where I am today. But as I grow older, I perceive my value as diminishing; I see fewer people falling in love with me.

Expanding outward, the people who I will always consider most like me--the people who grew up like me and to some extent look like me--don't have a good reputation either. This bothers me. They live, they smile; they struggle, they persevere. They win some and lose some and live and die and love and hate; what did they do in their life that made them less endearing to others? They had little, they have little, they'll likely end with little; is their material domain the reason for their ostracizing? 

If so, what can I do to expand their material domain? How can I raise their social worth to a level that gives them a level opportunity to be assessed, rather than being an exception to a general consensus--as I often feel I am. Making it personal again, how can I raise the reputation of those like me, thus increasing my opportunity to be loved again, just for being me?

This is the first problem I want to take the time to get right. I'll take the time to talk through the problem, ensuring its definition is accurate. Then I'll explore ways to address the issue, hopefully using the most effective solutions toward righting the situation. 

Something big is what I'm after now, what I'm living for.
