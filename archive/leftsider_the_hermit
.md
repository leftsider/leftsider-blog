There are so many places on the internet where you can find unhappy expatriates moaning endlessly about their Korean situation: the disadvantages, the stereotyping, and above all else the closed-minded attitude of Koreans. Well, I realized recently that I've become one of them.

Wait....not the foreigner; I've become one of the Koreans. I don't know when it started, but I see now that I'm on a path that aligns me dead on with most Koreans. I made it a point to assimilate myself, and perhaps I was a little too successful. I guess the only way for me to escape would be to leave the country.

Leaving Korea is really why I came to recognize my malady. Recently I spent two weeks in the US and I have never been happier than when I returned home--in Daegu. Here, where the streets smell and no one understands me; yes, here is where I spent most of my time in the US longing to be.

And now, with some vacation time coming up, Fru is talking about a trip to Japan. Japan? What's in Japan? Do we know anyone there? Can we communicate with anyone there? Why would I go there when there's so much undiscovered history even here in Daegu? Where will I stay? What will I eat? So many questions.....

Rewind about nine months and you probably would hear this conversation:

Friend: So you're moving to Korea?
Me: Yep
Friend: What's over there? Do you know anyone over there?
Me: No. I think some parents of some friends here....maybe some high school classmates...
Friend: Uh, so you don't know anyone and you don't speak Korean. Why are you going?
Me: Oh, just something new. And I'd like to learn Korean...it's an adventure!

Ok, back to the present.

Adventure? Ha! All I wanna do is just keep here. The unknown makes me nervous. I'm a simple guy now, leading a nice quiet simple life. That is, unless there's some noisy bummily-dressed foreigners nearby ruining my atmosphere. What are they, english teachers? Oh no, short haircuts; they must be military. Those are the only two categories available. Maybe I can get another table away from them....여기어...

Now I'm starting to get suspicious. More than one Korean has referred to me as "SuperKorean" in response to my actions. Have I gone to deep? Is this the point of no return? Will I paint a Korean flag on my face before shooting a sniper rifle out the window? Ok maybe that movie is too old for you to get that joke (IT IS A JOKE).

Anyway. I talked with an online acquaintance who's from Tokyo; he says that I'd enjoy it and meet lots of friendly people. Maybe I'll take his word and try something new.

I know. I think it sounds absolutely ridiculous coming out of my mouth as well.
