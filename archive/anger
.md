BODY:
For some reason, my site seems to be incredibly slow recently, and particularly when posting I've found it burdensome. Now, today, I've come to discover that as many as a half-dozen posts that I've done via bookmarklet (instead of from the site's CMS directly) have not even been saved. I'm not a happy camper. Changes are afoot.
