<blockquote>Right now it seems like Facebook is the new place to be. And right now I'm asking myself, "Why would I want to go anywhere else? This place is great!" My bet is that Facebook too, like any trendy nightclub, will fade out and there will be yet another cool online nightclub equivalent to join. Which begs the question, should social networks just do what nightclubs do every two years and just shut down and start over?</blockquote>

Interesting concept. How permanent should a social network be? Does it have a shelf life, or are creators obligated to keep it going?
