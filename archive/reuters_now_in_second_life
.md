Reuters Gets a Second Life - Video Game News - Digital Trends
</a>

<blockquote>International news service Reuters  announced today that it plans to open a virtual news bureau in the online virtual reality game Second Life from San Francisco's Linden Lab. The bureau will be run by a virtual representation of Reuters correspondent Adam Pasick, who will be present in the game under the name "Adam Reuters."</blockquote>

This is major. What does it mean when a real-world news agency dedicates a correspondent to cover the news of an online world? Does this redfine what "real-world" really means?
