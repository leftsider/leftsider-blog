On the return trip from our New York excursion, I realized that this trip had been the first time in ages that I wasn't adhering to a rigid schedule. We had planned two outings for the four-day trip, and the rest of the time was spent following our whims--or doing nothing at all. It's been a long time since I've been able to do that; since Korea, basically.

What I noticed, however, was that the whole trip seemed better because of it. If we had done more, rushing here and there, dragging friends and family along with us, I think the stress level would have been much higher. Instead, we did less, let things flow, and enjoyed a trip with no tensions. For some reason, this triggered a tangental trane of thought...why can't my life always be like this?

Looking at my model group--the rich and successful--I suppose their life is very much like that. They are responsible for big things and wield remarkable power, but they do very little. I'd imagine that they have someone who does their housekeeping, cooking, driving, etc., allowing them to only involve themselves when they want to; making even mundane tasks more enjoyable.

In their business, it should be much the same. The CEO steers the ship while others implement the directives they give. The captain lends a hand on a whim or when Davey Jones threatens to take the company under (sorry; watched Pirates II last weekend. Cragon!).

I wonder if I can do more to live my life in this way. If I try to do everything myself, I have not resources remaining for dreaming, planning, R&D. My vision becomes more short-sighted and my goals lose coherence. It boils down to just fighting a stressful, solitary battle to survive.
