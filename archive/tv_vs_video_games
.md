If you know anything about the way Leftsider does holidays, you will invariably expect to see a gaming console of some sort being heavily used during the festivities. It started in childhood, when my sister and I would eagerly anticipate visiting my cousins and their Nintendo. Our parents wouldn't allow us to own one, so we hoarded all the time we could with the precious machine while we were there. Conversely, our cousins would bring their games with them when they visited us....since there is nothing to do in the country for someone who grew up in the Bronx.

Now that we're all considerably older, I play video games only on occasion. For a while there Joey and I got pretty serious into some PS2 titles, but after his death my playstation  and OUR 25-30 games mysteriously vanished from the inventory. Returning back to the US, I had lost a lot of my gaming spirit.

Still, playing with my cousins is something that was a tradition. And, as it seems that I've given up Christmas to the in-laws to hold on to the sanctity of my beloved Thanksgiving, I decided to see if I could put a little bit of home in the mix. This time, I brought an Xbox along for the trip, with a few games.

Nobody in the house would touch the thing. Not a soul. Except for one visiting friend's boyfriend--who try very valiantly not to run down the stairs when I mentioned an xbox--I spent my entire gaming time in isolation.

Why? It seemed there was a stigma attached to playing video games. This surprised me as one guy was apparently a pretty active computer gamer and all of the guys had no problem sitting and channel surfing for hours on end. For me, I have a negative inclination to watching television.

I was born in front of a television. Growing up in rural America, it was my friend, my advisor, my babysitter, and, of course, my entertainment. I longed to leave the country to find more things to do. And once I did leave for more urban areas, my attachment to the television has consistently diminished. Today, I have not seen more than one episode of any show on television this season. I don't even know the names of half the shows. Sitting in my den watching TV makes me feel like a lower species; a slack-jawed, dull-eyed, cretin. 

Which I am, but only in regards to the internet. Remember that.

Imagine the awkwardness of the olive branch offers: They decline when I offer them a controller, I have no idea when they ask me what I want to watch on television. There was no middle ground; I realized that the two activities were so close--the same screen--but oh so far.

I still contend that when I watch TV I feel like I'm <em>doing nothing</em>. I sit; the screen shoves crap down my senses and my only option is to change the channel. I don't create, filter, or edit what any particular channel gives me. I can change the channel but I cannot change the content. I sit; not using any muscles and very little intellect. The show always explains an ending and gives my clues when to laugh or feel some other emotion. While I sit and stare at a screen online, I do choose exactly what I see; video games have an ultimate ending but I must think and interact to get there.

Perhaps my perception of gaming has changed. Indeed, my ideas about television have. With new, more family-friendly consoles like the Wii, will gaming gain a greater foothold on the traditional picture of the family gathered around the television (remember when that was the radio? or even just the fireplace?)? Which do you think is more sociable?
