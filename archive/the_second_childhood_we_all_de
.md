The slowdown that Leftsider has been experiencing is largely due to the glut of deadlines looming over my head like a weary ghost. Since I must appease these academic spirits with APA-format incantations, I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and post a few here. Feel free to read at your whim.

The first was written quite some time ago, but it is relatively light. It was in reference to <a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200702/200702160007.html">this editorial piece</a> in the Chosun Ilbo.

=========

During my time in South Korea, I took every opportunity I could find to explore the culture, traditions and natural beauty of the peninsular country. When resources would permit, I would also take  advantage of the country's location to leapfrog to neighboring Asian countries--to see what wonderful treasures they held and experience their unique perspectives on life. As I did this, one thing was always beside me as a consistent object of familiarity; the 할머님(Korean grandmother) and 할아버지님(Korean grandfather).

South Koreans often refer to retirement as a second childhood; one that allows them to shrug off the responsibilities and burdens that they have shouldered and live out their remaining years as they wish--and as their investments have provided. It explains why most tourist areas in
the country are swarming with seniors in small groups or on tours and attempts an accommodating explanation for their cantankerous and often nearly shameless behavior. Their small, bent frames testify to the dues they have paid  in the rapid development of one of Asia's largest economies; it is only fitting to allow them their declining years in wandering, wine and revelry.

Chosun Dailly columnist Hong-Sub Choi writes that South Korea does itself a disservice by not employing well into elderly ages. He looks at the veritable ocean of wisdom and experience that they hold and asserts that it is best used by reentry into the Korean workforce. Looking at other countries who are pushing back the age of retirement or who currently allow workers to continue well into their years, he sees his own country at a loss by not putting this demographic back on the job.

EXTENDED BODY:
Choi looks towards the actions of other states as an indication of South Korean inefficiency, not as responses to their own problems. He does not recognize the cultural differences of European countries that would not provide for the same level of stability and freedom for their aged. He also overlooks the fact that, like South Korea, Japan is a rapidly aging country. In a much more dire situation, Japan is doing all that it can to sustain its maturing population. South Korea has both a distinct advantage and an admirable difference that allows this phenomenon to be; yet listening to this argument, it would seem that it is true that the grass is always greener on the other side.

This second childhood is a sign of success; the right of the retired and a responsibility of the current working class. To remove it from the traditions of the Korean community would be the greater disservice to society and yet another casualty of the uniformity of globalization. There are better ways that the public could be served by the wisdom and experience of the previous generation, and a holistic approach is favorable over one that places weight on those back which have already carried so much.

In other areas of the world, there is a looming uncertainty that hangs over retirement. In western philosphies, individualistic agendas and allegiance to industry and the almighty dollar has left little room for family, let alone provision for those before us. African and Asian cultures whose principles are built around the importance of the community have a built-in structure for respecting elders and make provisions for their care. This gives those further in years the option to rest from their toils or to continue contributing to their society. They do what makes them happy; working becomes a method of comfortability instead of a matter of necessity, as it is for many older people around the world.

Even in countries where community is not as significant, there continues to be a concept of reaping the benefits of a life of hard work. South Korean seniors are a working model of such a reward for labors. A family raised successfully, in tandem with wise investments, means a life of ease in the end. Their ability to travel even in their later years is a testament to healthful living and hearty character. Truly, they act as ambassadors when traveling to various resorts and destinations, showing to all who see them that there is an element in Korean society that provides longevity in well-being.

In turn, these elders are stimulating their minds by exposing themselves to new locations, experiences, and cultures. It is well documented that constant mental stimulation is essential to clarity of mind and elasticity into our later years. This travel provides much needed neurological exercise while allowing them to apply a mature and experienced eye to the cultures which they interact with. Such assessment would be the perfect way to utilize the wisdom of this age group, as their reflections may have a distinct profundity that is cultivated from their life experiences. Additionally, they would be less likely to stay abroad to take advantage of the cultures they experience than a young student or a professional with a career still ahead of him.

To be truthful, the current generation's neglect of the teachings of the previous generation in total acceptance of a more global worldview is a large factor in the workforce issues that Choi presents. Abandonment of familial responsibilities and traditions have placed increasing strain on the social structure of Korean society. As has happened Japan, the current generation is increasingly abandoning their duties to their parents, leaving them to fend for themselves. If this is to continue unchecked, then the discussion here is moot; Korean grandparents will find themselves forced to work in order to survive. Rather than enjoying the fruits of their labor, they will find that their labor is fruitless and endless, as it is for many in other parts of the world.

Adaptation of individualistic goals have squeezed the size of the Korean family smaller and smaller, and the priority of a family has been lessened. The lower birth rate in rapidly developing states such as Korea and Japan is the issue that would be better addressed than that of whether our aged should be re-employed. An increase in value to the family would also provide seniors with an outlet to share their experiences and perspectives, passing down their knowledge to a new generation.

Of course, this is not to say that the old ways cannot be adjusted. What is needed is a balanced approach that is sensitive to both the developments of the modern world as well as the established practices that can be hailed as progressive. There still is room for improvement in both areas. If more experience and talent is needed to bolster the workforce, perhaps an accelerated path to equality between genders would be a more productive effort. There are many capable workers who are not seen as equal to their peers, and are often forced into a semi-retirement long before the retirement age is attained. Provisions to symbiotically tap into the abilities of those Koreans who are of mixed heritage should also be addressed.

In short, retirement is the second childhood that we all deserve. It should not be discredited solely because of an international tendency, nor should society's elders be forced to use their wisdom experience because our generation has neglected to accept their discipleship and training. South Korea has a unique opportunity to stand as a beacon to a successful method and should preserve it rather than sacrifice it.

I think the elderly should be able to make their own decision in if they want to keep working or not.
In Germany they get pushed and pushed to older ages. A goal most of them never reach to begin with... :(

I like the idea of second childhood. Never knew that.
Maybe because I didn't see many happy retired people in Waegwan ;)
