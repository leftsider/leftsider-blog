<blockquote>At first, the site attracted only a handful of gardeners. But after a formal dedication ceremony, a number of farmers, including Latino immigrants who had initially hesitant, began to establish plots. From the mid-1990s until 2006, the South Central Farm, as gardeners came to call it, evolved into a striking landscape. Eventually as many as 350 Latino gardeners (or campesinos) participated in growing such crops as corn, beans, and nopales cactus, and herbs like jimsonweed and cilantro. They grew guava and other fruits. “The plants sown only intensified the otherworldliness of the place,” reporter Emily Green said of the garden in a 2004 Los Angeles Times magazine story. Latino New Urbanist James Rojas characterized the farm as a mini “pueblo” for its community activities. Land that was otherwise surrounded by warehouses, truck traffic, and the Alameda rail lines, was completely transformed.

As an urban place, the farm also turned into a safe haven - drug-free, gang-free, and graffiti-free. Reconstructing a kind of urban plaza and green space familiar to Latino immigrants, the garden facilitated social networks and was a gathering spot for families. On any given day, it attracted as many people as could be found in some city parks. The campesinos also established traditions like the Garden Day L.A. celebration, where food and plant vendors, musicians, and folklorica dancers gathered for a day-long fair. </blockquote>

Sad Ending. :(
