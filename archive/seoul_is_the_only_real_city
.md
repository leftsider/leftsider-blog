<blockquote>Now don't get me wrong: I love New York, and I'm happy and proud to call it my home. But you really can't compare its tepid comings and goings to life in this surging metropolis of eighteen million, hunkered down on the banks of the Han River.</blockquote>

It's true, folks, it's true. I've never heard it described that way, but, from my initial reaction, describing urban Korea as "a culture that believes it has a future" is the most accurate I've heard yet. 

In contrast... the US? Do we believe we have a future, or do we believe that we are the future? Are there ramifications to that slight difference in philosophy?
