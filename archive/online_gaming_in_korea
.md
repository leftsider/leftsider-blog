BODY:
Online gaming in Korea is like nothing else I've ever seen. I was trying to come up with a witty comparison to something in the US or another country but it's just not possible. There's nowhere else where you can have so many people--men, women, children, seniors--involved in one thing with so much fervor.

I've been trying to get "an in" into the scene since, say, the second day I got here. Unfortunately, most programs here are entirely in Korean, making it difficult for me to make my own way.

Then, after a month of searching I found <a href="http://www.gamengame.com/">this site</a>. I nearly wet myself with joy, even though they only offer four games converted into english for FREE online play. 

Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't download the games! Some type of FTP error....I can't tell since I'm not that fluent in Korean yet. But rest assured. I won't stop trying. If anyone out there has "an in" on the Korean gaming world, let a brother know.
