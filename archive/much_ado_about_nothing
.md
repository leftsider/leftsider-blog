Spent another day mostly downtown; this time with Robert "Whatitis" from the other Daegu SDA language institute. Initially we had wanted to get together and take the Daegu City Bus Tour, but we found out too late that is was an all-day tour which starts at 10am. Not wanting to go back to the construction zone that is our place, we just went downtown.

When I go downtown these days, I feel like a pet that has been kept inside too long. In the same way that they run around and sniffing every leg, marking every tree, I feel that I'm amazed by downtown's wares not for any exceptional qualities that they possess--rather, it's just because I'm deprived.

With today being the third time I've hit the strip in four days I had to ask myself, "What is really so cool about this place?" It's definitely not the <a href="http://www.twin-music.com/azlyrics/c_file/songs/clark/down.html">downtown</a> I knew. I haven't seen any jazz caf√©s, lounges, eclectgic bookstores, record shops, skate parks, international cuisines, or street art. I've never been able to get someone to accopmany me downtown on a late-night meandering (and the 30,000won cab ride back prohibits me from doing it solo). With all the things I love so much so rare, it's no wonder I'm like a 15-year old at the mall without the 'rents. 

I've got some ideas for remedying this malady. I'll fill you in on it soon.
