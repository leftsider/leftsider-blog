With no real news on the homefront, I'll leave you with an interesting proverb: 
호랑이 굴에 가야 호랑이를 잡는다. 
(If you want catch a tiger, you have to go to the tiger’s cave.)

A lot like the people who protray opium addicts on movies.

Wait...people still do that??? There's a market for this?

I never knew how much of a dork I was until I saw this. Now THAT's geek humor.
