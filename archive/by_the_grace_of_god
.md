BODY:
I'm the kind of guy who spends a lot of time thinking about things... too much, usually. One thing I feel I always should ponder is who I should thank.

It's more complicated than it seems. For example, if I had not become friends with a certain kid named Jason my freshman year of high school, I'd have never met my wife, would never have gotten the job that allowed me to go to Korea, nor would I have been in a position to take advantage of the opportunity to work at Twitter (have I written about that?). 

Jason did nothing but befriend me, but he is one of the most influential people in my life. I did nothing to deserve much of what I've enjoyed in my life. I feel I've been a pretty mediocre performer in much of what I do, and I dont hide this fact. There's a term I love, "unmerited favor," that I think is a big part of my life. This term is also a definition for "grace."

At the beginning of the [Pledge and Law](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/#001240) I learned so many years ago, there lies a condition to all that a Pathfinder is and that one might become: by the grace of God. Considering that most of my childhood friends have criminal records, most of my high school friends are divorced, and most of my family hasn't seen the other side of this country--let alone the other side of the world, I consider myself privileged far beyond what I deserve, and favored in ways I can't explain.

The happiness I enjoy is not the culmination of my efforts, but the gracious gift One was kind enough to bestow. It's good to remind myself of that, and to start my intentions from a point of thankfulness.
