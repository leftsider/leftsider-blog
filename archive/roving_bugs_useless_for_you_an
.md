<blockquote>"The FBI can access cell phones and modify them remotely without ever having to physically handle them," James Atkinson, a counterintelligence security consultant, told ABC News.  "Any recently manufactured cell phone has a built-in tracking device, which can allow eavesdroppers to pinpoint someone's location to within just a few feet," he added.</blockquote>
I know that there have been some regulations to standardize GPS or some other tracking requirements for mobile phones...they've been talking about that for years. 

But if it is useful to this degree of reconnaissance, why were we unsuccessful with the Kim family and the hikers recently? To what extent do we effectively use technology, and who decides in which direction a technology is applied?
