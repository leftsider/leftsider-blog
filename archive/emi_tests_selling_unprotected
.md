Also <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16081654/">here</a>. I really hope that this is something that will produce favorable results. I really would make a man like me hang up much of his pirating days if this were to happen.

There are others who say it much more poignantly than I can. But the fact remains: I'd consider even paying $100 a month for access to an unlimited database of unrestricted music from the major labels.  Think audio-on-demand on your DAP, your mobile device, your home stereo, or your satellite-enabled car radio. It'd be well worth it.

Any reason why that wouldn't work? And isn't the plural for mp3 still mp3?
