I've gone and done it...I've fallen for a Korean Drama.

It was bound to happen. I was fresh off of two novelas on Telemundo, in a new country with lots of time on my hands, and,well, this one is so cute!!!

<a title="쾌걸춘향" href="http://www.kbs.co.kr/drama/qgirl/index.html">쾌걸춘향</a>(roughly translated by me as "Carefree Girl, Chun Hyang") is a teen-oriented drama loosely based on the traditional Korean historical story, Chunhyang. In the original story there's a guy and a girl who fall in love  but the guy's parents move or something and he goes off to take the exam to become an official. His girl stays true to him, even though the governor has his sights on her. When he realizes he can't have her, he really punishes her--to the point of sentencing her to be executed. Her suitor returns as a peasant, she professes her love to him from prison, and he saves her from death on her execution day (he actually passed the exam with flying colors and became an undercover corruption-buster for the emperor). They get together, happy ending.

I had heard about the show but hadn't seen it until they aired a rerun yesterday. Frulwinn and I liked it so much, that when she told me it was on today, I was there. In this modern day tale, Myong Lyong and Chun Yang are hip kids in Seoul, where she works in a jewelry shop and designs pieces as a passion. The bad governor is now a media bigshot who has his eyes set on her and won't take no. Again, it's LOOSELY based, but just enough to make it work without you knowing exactly what's going to happen.

Tonight was the episode where they part ways. Instead of Myong Long leaving for educational reasons, he and Chun Hyang are pitted against each other by the bad dude and end up breaking on bad terms. She goes to leave with bad dude while her beau drinks away his sorrows. His friend does him a good deed and she softens her heart to him, but only while he's passed out. By the time they both seek out each other, they've crossed paths and actually are in two buses to two different towns sitting right next to each other at a traffic light (only in Korean drama). They miss each other even then, and so the story stays true to the original tale.

They also do this silly thing at the end of each episode where the story reverts back to the old-fashioned one, but there's always something to throw it off. Yesterday they're in old traditional clothes in an old traditional setting talking when one guy's cellphone goes off; this week Myong Lyong's making a emperial seal--but instead of chiseling the features he just uses a marker.  =o]

So as you can see, I'm hooked. I think there's a way to watch the episodes online, but all the info is in Korean (obviously) so seek out your friendly Korean friend and ask them if they know about 쾌걸춘향!!!
