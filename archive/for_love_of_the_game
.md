Read this article a while back and felt it worth sharing. A girl's softball team that hadn't lost a game in two years offers to forfeit their match against a poorly prepared team who were playing their first game in school history. Instead of destroying the team that showed up with only two bats, no cleats or helmets, the Roncalli softball team offered to take the two hours to teach the other girls "how to get better, not how to get humiliated."

In agreement with the author of the article, this is a great piece for those of us who still believe in sportsmanship, kindness and graciousness. Warm fuzzies all around.
