How do we define truth? In an overwhelming amount of situations, we observe truth only in the perspectives that are natural to us. This is not unusual; after all, <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/11/network_disconnect.htm">how can you view something from a perspective that you do not know</a>?

This idea alone is enough to interest me in lifetime of discovery and exploration. <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/08/combating_stupidity.htm">My world is one-dimensional</a> until I view it from the position of another. My truth, indeed, lies flat until viewed from all sides. This is important because only through this process can we separate truth from tradition.

This is an idea that has fascinated me for sometime now. I first noticed it when I travelled to Tanzania in 2001. During my stay I discovered that the format of church worship in Christian churches was much the same as it was in North America. Order of the service, style of the building of worship, even dress in many cases was identical to an old-school, conservative church. 

While it was comforting to find something that was similar to my style of living, I realized almost immediately that this format had little to no relevance in the everyday lives of the people. The contrast between their weekday and their day of Christian worship was like <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/02/flickrphoto_border_solid_28.htm">night and day</a>. How could these people understand a God who was supposed to be a daily companion and provider if the only way they knew to be in touch with him was through a foreign module? Could they have been given a new religion that was not so entwined with geographical tradition?

For a long time, I thought about the division of truth and tradition. Specifically, I examined my religious principles. But, eventually, this koan of sorts has permeated into my entire life philosophy. Questions of what I study, who I admire, where I live, how I commute and even the purpose of this site have been re-processed through this intellectual strainer, in hopes of a more refined, less defaulted lifestyle. 

I believe that life should be deliberate. You are not required to deliberate upon tradition; rather, <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/11/quote_of_the_day.htm">it completely allows you to be free of any responsibility</a> to assessing and validating your course. Of course you can <em>choose</em> to follow tradition, but few people do that. It's quite often a choice unmade; a default instituted.

In a statement, to live is a completely and markedly different experience than to exist. Which experience allows you a better opportunity to understand truth more fully?
