For most of human civilization, the quality of a product was equivalent to its usefulness. As a hunter, the inferior bow or arrow meant less accuracy; a dull or brittle spearhead was not effective and thus would not be worth purchasing. As a gatherer, good fruit taken meant mouths fed while those rotten or unripe would have no purpose and could instead bring sickness. In all cases from the earliest of man forward, quality meant satisfaction.

That is, until industrialization hit us. Once production left the hands of the artisan and was placed in the steely arms of machinery, the quality of a product became less about the satisfaction it provided and more about production's consistent output. In essence, it became a marker of the minimum effort and skill necessary for consumers to find a product useful; a whole science of quality control has been since developed [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control), ensuring the highest quality product at the lowest cost point--very useful to the manufacturer but only marginally to the user. When quality became a price point--by which people chose to accept products of mediocre build or spend the extra money for  hand-crafted artisan work--it created the breeding ground for two strange phenomena: the idea of disposability and the sense of "good enough."

As we hurtle through the age of digitalization these things still matter but in different ways. Manufacturers still need to control their output so that it retains a quality that the consumer finds valuable, but the digital product can be duplicated with practically no cost (Consider: how much does it cost you to make a copy of a file on your computer? Two clicks and an allocation of space? How much more does it cost a software company?). As a result, the margin of cost (initial creation + duplication) between a bespoke digital object and a mass-produced one gets smaller every day. Disposability becomes both essential and irrelevant; with low expense, I can use a product for a one-off task (freeware/shareware thrives on this concept)--but why throw it away? The cost to keep it is equally miniscule. There have been times that I've downloaded an application, immediately used it, and just as quickly had no use for it whatsoever; many of those applications still reside on my computer because the effort in finding and deleting is greater than the resource it takes just staying there. relatively new concepts in commerce like the app stores for Android and Apple mobile devices cater specifically to this line of thinking.

This says a lot more about consumer satisfaction than the original industrial process ever did. It says, "if it works, I can do what I planned on doing--and that makes me happy." In truth, a product's usefulness never stopped providing satisfaction; we just lost quality as a tool to measure it. Instead, we chased quality unnecessarily to higher price points that, in many cases, did not really do much difference in the way we enjoyed the results but rather indicated status. Audiophiles may adequately justify their expensive equipment, but there's a reason mainstream producers often take their work out of the studio and listen to it in a car or earbud headphones: when it comes to enjoying the music, often just hearing it is good enough.

Pick a song, any song. If it ever was popular at all, chances are you can find it on YouTube right now. If it had a music video, there's a good chance that is there as well, though more often than not it will simply be a picture of the artist, an album cover, or a collage of marginally-related images that the uploader has put together. Hundreds of thousands of inferior quality audio files attached to inferior quality imagery online--an inferior medium--yet really obscure items like collaboration project Butter 08's 1997 track "Butter of 69" [*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WweOg2krMPE) currently has over 30,000 views. Why would poor quality video or even a static image get hundreds of thousands of views? Because people just want to hear the music, and will often let it play in the background, ignoring the image completely. More importantly, there are scores of downloadable and web-based applications that will extract the audio and give it to you in mp3 form. It nearly guarantees that your audio will not be as good as what was originally recorded, but what does that matter? Just having may be good enough.

Growing up in a lower-income, rural environment, the term "good enough" is imprinted in my bones. With so many things economically and logistically out of reach, adults admonished children to make do with what was available. Today, it seems I wasn't the only one given this advice. In addition to pulling sub-quality (in the industrial sense) audio from unlikely sources, people are using their computers to make phone calls, using their phones to take pictures, and using their photo cameras to record video [*](http://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/magazine/17-09/ff_goodenough). Long gone are the days of "the right tool for the job," if it will get it done, it'll do.

This sets the basis for much of the work that many of us do. So very often we are swept up in the latest technology which pushes the boundaries of what is possible when, in reality, our work is much less bleeding edge and much more center of the bell curve. Forget what's new; what's most common to the user? In "About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design," [*](http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/0470084111) Alan Cooper and team remind us that the center of the expertise scale is exactly where we should be aiming. The high end usually has a learning curve that is not worth the consumer's investment; the low end is too simplistic for most and very few hope to remain clueless users. When we design for the "That'll Do" generation, we bring a balance that humans already have a knack for implementing--through compromise--in their daily lives.

The result is a shift in the post-industrial mentality. The new, post-analogue, digital mentality is one in which the artisan resurfaces, incarnate in every person who creates, manipulates or modifies digitized data. That data itself is by its very nature open to change: edit, deconstruction and reconstruction are its strengths--an attribute never seen before the digital world. Finally, those who see the larger picture of data pervasiveness are given the opportunity to design the parameters by which human interaction with non-human objects is guided.
