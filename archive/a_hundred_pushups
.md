BODY:
If you know me, you know I'm privy to far-reaching, barely logical, nearly irrelevant ideas. Like the time that I tried to get Cesar to take up fencing with me (neither of us did). Or when I <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/11/house-and-home.htm">made my wife stop cleaning the house</a>. To me, it's precisely the novelty of it all that makes it worthwhile. Which is why it seems I'm following <a href="http://twitter.com/Joi/statuses/841188238">Joi</a> once again (the first time was with <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2007/05/25/neti-pot.html">neti pot</a>), undertaking this <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">Hundred Pushups</a> meme. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.hundredpushups.com/"><img src="http://hundredpushups.com/images/onehundred468x60.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I can't think of one thing that I want that will be achieved by doing this, nor can I think of one ability i'll have that I don't currently possess. Perhaps it's the mental discipline that's attracting me; heaven knows I could use some. Either way, I'll go through with it and see you on the other side. ^^<br /><br />Better yet, why don't you join me? You can look sexy for the last months of beach season...<br />
