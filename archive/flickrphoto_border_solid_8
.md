<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	When I was in high school, I asked Frulwinn what her favorite flower was. She told me that she really liked orchids. Since then, I've always thought about her whenever I run across mention of these flowers.<br />
<br />
At the back of the Singapore Botanical is an Orchid Garden. In fact, I believe that it's the world's largest orchid garden. I made sure to put this on our list of things to do, hoping to see my wife swoon.<br />
<br />
As we entered the garden, I asked her, "Aren't orchids your favorite flower?"<br />
<br />
"No; Calla Lilies," she replied. "I think they're my mom's favorite though. She would love this." <br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
I guess it's easy to see that time changes things. Oh well. <br />
<br />
The safari excited her, and she did say she enjoyed the orchid garden. But I've still got tricks up my sleeve....<br />
<br />
(btw, there's a ton of flower pics on flickr if you're interested. I tend to go crazy when in a garden with a camera.)
