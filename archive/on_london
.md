This is the second time that I've visited London. The first was a 14-hour layover on my way to eastern Africa. With such short time and a need to move from Heathrow to Gatwick airports, I really was limited in what I could do. I caught the train from Heathrow to Picadilly Circus and wandered around aimlessly, dropping pounds (currency, not fat) as I went. Then, I headed back, and before you knew it I was gone.

This time, I went for the GIEN 2007 forum, which wasn't actually in London but in <a href="http://www.plazes.com/plazes/26481:coppid_beech_hotel">Bracknell</a>. Bracknell is to the London city area what Columbia or Fredricksburg is to the DC metropolitan area: not really in it. So a trip to London required an hour train ride and, yes, yet more pounds. 

It would seem that London does not want to have a relationship with me. For all its history, style and status, it is somewhat difficult to ascertain, aloof and exclusive. Part of this I lay on the fact that it is the only country I've been to whose currency far outvalues the US dollar; so, in effect, I may be experiencing what everyone else experiences, well, everywhere else.

To its merit, I have little to say that is negative about Englanders. They are particularly humorous, down to earth and very approachable. I found this a much-needed salve for my bruised British interactions.

Would I go again? Absolutely? Soon? No, not soon. I'll wait for the terror activities to die down and (hopefully) the dollar to have a more favorable exchange rate.
