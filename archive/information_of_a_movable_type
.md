BODY:
Writing a letter or official document has always needed special attention and care. When proclamations needed to be sent out across dynastic-era China, however, the sheer volume of reproduction necessary required a system less time consuming. Woodblock printing became a norm for this kind of task, and was appropriate for the job as Chinese writing has a pictogram (based on drawing) and ideogram (representing a concept) character basis.

Even so, in the 11th century, Chinese commoner Bi Sheng developed a movable type printing technology using clay blocks. This was improved on by Wang Zhen who is credited with inventing in 1298 the first wooden movable type printing in the world. Metal blocks were developed in Korea in 1234 and the oldest surviving metal print book was printed in 1377, approximately 78 years before Johannes Gutenberg's 42-Line Bibles were printed.

What's special about movable type printing is its flexibility. Before, a printed page required a monolithic mirrored carving; that carving would only be useful for that one process and nothing more. Movable type was a carving of each character, and the arrangement of these characters could be reformulated--making the blocks reusable. Clearly this would have a greater impact in languages that use an alphabetic script, and Gutenberg's press changed printing forever.

EXTENDED BODY:
Much has been said about the impact that movable type has had on print culture, information sharing, market capacity and society in general. Gutenberg is listed as the most influential man in the last 1000 years on several rankings. But I'd like to stay focused on the flexible medium that allowed all this to happen. There we find some interesting clues to activities occurring in our own world today.

Taking a large item and breaking it into smaller parts is not new. A mason carves stones from a mountainside to create a wall miles away; items purchased from the market are divided into portions that can be transported in bags. What movable type offers, however, is fragmentation to the smallest size of common value. This greatest common denominator could then be implemented in any larger system which required it, and tremendously extended the value of something that originally was designed for single use. In fact, printing the word "pan" and the word "nap"--two words having completely different meanings altogether--use the exact same parts. Add an "e" and you've got "nape," "pen," "pea" and so on. 

In "Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations," Clay Shirky explains how an increase quantity does not always have an equivalent increase in function. In this case, the increase in individually applicable characters increases quite dramatically. This seems obvious, but consider how much less useless your computer keyboard would be if your "e" and "w" keys were joined as one doubled sized key that output "we." Even though you end up with just one less key, the keyboard would be largely unusable. You'd be likely to throw out that keyboard--provided it isn't attached to your laptop.

In today's world, our interaction with products yield a similar malaise. Because a product is designed to appease a target audience--and not a specific person--it may be uncommon to find commercially distributed goods that are designed to serve the greatest common factor; the basis of all needs. Instead, we are often given something of a least common denominator--the smallest thing under which all our collective problem fits. It is no different in the digital realm; something added (bloatware), something missing (crippleware) or something broken into sections (a template or model) rather than broken into elemental values, the keys to development.

But not all digital products have this problem. Digital products that have no commercial intent are less likely to be designed to meet the needs of many; as such they maybe be very useful to a select few. When combined with other products, they may contribute to a system that is dramatically more flexible specifically because it is constructed of pieces of small, common value. 

Because digital products have a particular disposition to duplication and modification, they are much easier to adapt than tangible items. One digital tool applied to an audio file and another converting that audio file creates a ringtone that perhaps I should have purchased. While photoshopping, mashups and program cracks push the boundaries of ethics and integrity, not everything that the flexibility of modularity affords must border on the illicit. A positive (though presented in a way not immediately clear) example would be Yahoo pipes.

When we allow the consumer to participate in the creation of digital content as equals--ripping, modifying, remixing without reservation--we are seeing the digital version of the movable type: rapid reformulation, reusability of one-off tools, and dramatic expansion in opportunistic range. Which essentially is the basis of the revolution that changed everything.
