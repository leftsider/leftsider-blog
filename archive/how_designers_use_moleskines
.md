<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/523487954/">I bought a moleskine notebook</a> in hopes that it would help me with getting out some ideas trapped within. Largely, I consider it a failure because the one I purchased is graph-lined. I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/36999785/">already have</a> a graph-lined, leather-bound notebook which I've already become <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/812054897/">more accustomed to</a>, and I think my problem is that the lines define me (perhaps an unlined version would have been a better option).
