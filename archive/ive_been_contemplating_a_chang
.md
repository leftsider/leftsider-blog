I've been contemplating a change in philosophy regarding games. If I do accept this new line of thinking, I may never buy a console again.

Today, more than ever, everything I do is mobile. My primary machine is a laptop; my backup is on a portable drive. I sync my calendar, contacts and notes between my PDA, mobile, and computers. So why would I want to be tethered to a home appliance to play games? I think that even the manufacturers know this. Now every console has online play, wireless controllers...but is that enough? Portable gaming takes it the next step; in your hand, wherever you go.

What's more, consoles seem to be going crazy in price. The $400 Xbox360 seems downright practical in comparison with the PS3. I was a Sony fanboy for a long, long time--basically until I went to Korea. Never before have I been so uninterested in a Playstation console than I am now. Regardless of what it's capable of doing, I find it unreasonably priced.  I could buy a PSP and a DSlite to take with me wherever I go....and probably have enough change left over for a Wii.
