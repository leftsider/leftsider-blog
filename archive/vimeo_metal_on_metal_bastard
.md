BODY:
A music video with a scathing (though valid) assessment of society. History repeats itself; yesterday's bread and circuses have resurfaced as today's cut-throat capitalism and reality television. 

Probably would not have ever seen this, but found while cruising [juststuffifind](http://juststuffifind.com/2009/12/08/glue-society/) and clicked because anything that has table tennis (and especially women's table tennis) I'm watching. :)
