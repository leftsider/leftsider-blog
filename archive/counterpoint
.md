I think of counterpoint nearly every time I find myself unintentionally groovin' to [Justin Timberlake's "Rock Your Body"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSVHoHyErBQ) at some gas station or shopping mall or wherever they play music like that. It was a popular song when it released, but no one ever noted the wonderful (and quite rare for our time) polyphony found in its bridge. I'm not even sure if [the girl who sang the other half](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Marquez_(singer)) is still singing, let alone better off due to the song's fame. 

But I digress; we're talking about **counterpoint**--where two (or more) distinct melodies operate simultaneously, relying on each other's presence to bring harmonic effect. Wikipedia considers Bach to be the greatest practitioner, and it seems that it becomes more rare in music as you move forward in history.

I think counterpoint is evidenced in other aspects of life, and can even be considered an ideal outcome for many of our societal problems. What would happen if two opposing points of view positioned themselves to balance the other rather than to assault or defend? What if tools like consideration and empathy were strategically implemented instead of victory and profit? Perhaps even these more aggressive tactics could be paired with more compassionate perspectives to create a third layer--and a clear objective presentation for those looking on.

Counterpoint represents harmony without dependence, collaboration without compulsion; the sum of a positive and  negative being greater than its individual parts. is this something we could find useful in our human development?
