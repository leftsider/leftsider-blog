<a title="CNN.com - Goats, cows offered for Chelsea - Jul 27, 2005" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/07/27/clinton.kenya.ap/index.html">CNN.com - Goats, cows offered for Chelsea</a>


Why have I seen this story in two different places? Are we that low on news?

Having been to Kenya, I'm partial and would say that it would be culturally sensitive for someone (even if it isn't Bill) send him a letter declining his offer. Or, sell him Chelsea.

Why not? It'll just be more publicity for America's favorite first family. Enough publicity, in fact, that we probably could get a reality TV show out of the deal; and we all know how that helped Paris Hilton.

There are other plusses too. How about the novelty of a Kenyan son-in-law for the Hillary2008 presidential campaign. No one could say she was inexperienced in international affairs--there's a little of that happening every time the kid comes home. And what about US-Kenya relations. They're already ok, but it shows you're really willing to take one for the team (unlike your husband, who got one and refused to admit it).

For those of you worried about young Clinton's happiness and safety, I have three words for you: Trust Fund Baby. She has backing so financial support can't be placed over her head. In fact, her suitor better be prepared to hand his cojones over in a crystal carafe since she's reportedly pulling in six figures from her current job. Altogether, She'd be more equal financially with a retired Kenyan president than with Mr. Chepkurgor. She has nothing to fear.

So, let's just turn our brains off completely and watch hilarity ensue. There's nothing that Americans love more than a good show, and this one has all the markings of a classic. Plus, if someone can buy a successful First Daughter with livestock, I'm sure I could get <a href="http://www.hancinema.net/korean_Han_Chae-young.php?news=1601#news">Han Chae Young</a> for a steal. :)
