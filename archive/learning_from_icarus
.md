Perhaps all dreams have an end--not just the ones we experience in our sleep but also the ones that we achieve in our waking hours. Perhaps the destination is truly just the end of a journey. If so, what next? Keep beating a dead horse? On to bigger, brighter things?

What propels us forward, and what are the limits/constraints that propulsion adheres to? It is fantasy to imagine that every person in the world is capable of every possible dream; thus it must mean that there are boundaries to where we should wander as we seek our fortune.

Like Icarus [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus), perhaps we find that striving too high (or for too long) leaves us depleted of the resources necessary to complete the journey. Perhaps by insisting upon doing/living/being more, we are setting ourselves up for a catastrophic fall from grace.

> Ambition is a gilded misery, a secret poison, a hidden plague, the engineer of deceit, the mother of hypocrisy, the parent of envy, the original of vices, the moth of holiness, the blinder of hearts, turning medicines into maladies, and remedies into diseases. --Thomas Brooks

Embrace your dreams, but know your self.
