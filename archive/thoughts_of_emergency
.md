BODY:
Today my sister spent the day in the hospital, and just now has 
come out of emergency surgery.

EXTENDED BODY:
It's difficult, for many reasons, to describe how and why I feel. The primary emotion is possibly mild frustration for the situation to be serious enough to warrant concern but not enough to clearly justify driving the two hours over. As it being my little sister, I am very much wanting to be by her side. For a short, routine in-and-out exploratory surgery, though, I might better save my visit for recovery time or, in a less favorable scenario, for support for a subsequent surgical need.

Which is also why I feel some moderate frustration about the lack of clear information I have about the situation. I rely on my sister to give me the closest thing to an intelligent, objective analysis of what happens back home. With her under the knife, I have to rely on opinions I haven't previously qualified, reports riddled with medical wariness, and passive responses. Fortunately I was able to get off a couple text messages to my sister, to which she replied and made me somewhat ok with not driving over.

With all the thoughts swirling in my head these days, this situation has dropped in and demanded my attention. In many ways I've got a clarity right now that I have not had for a long time. I had just settled in to some serious study when the situation became more complicated, yet, when faced with this, it became embarrasingly clear the order to which my allegiances lie. Family will <em>always</em> be first in my priorities, and the other things are just tributaries that feed into what I hope will be come a larger stream of resources to those whom I hold dear. Kim's ordeal has been a wake-up call to remember <em>why</em> all of this that I'm doing is important.

That's it. Just wanted to document my thoughts. Also, due to studying and the little worry I had, I've a bit of insomnia.
