Using a wiki to find something I don't know? I've been doing it for a while and have found it very useful.

Using a wiki as a reference in an assignment? I was a little leary at first, but these days it's a real, valid resource.

Now Kottke shows me another excellent use for wikis--travel planning. First time I using TravelWiki but it gave me great info for the trip I'm currently planning, our Christmas vacation to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>*.


*Yes. Philippines has been officially removed from our Christmas plans. We have friends there (sorry!) but Frulwinn's parents were successful in making us question our personal security. So we're going somewhere with relatively lower chance of harm.
