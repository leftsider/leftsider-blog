	If you were in the boat with us, looking where I took this picture, you would have seen THOUSANDS of fireflies flashing, making the trees along the water blink like christmas trees. Apparently, the all stopped bllinking when the shutter opened. <br />

Kidding; though I do wonder what it would take to capture something like that in a picture.<br />
