BODY:
Man first produced for survival: necessary tools to build, food to eat, clothing for protection. It is only natural, then, that when products end up traded, purchased or sold we automatically think of the economic model of "supply and demand." Why would someone sell something that they needed, and why would anyone purchase or trade for something of no personal use? Because of surplus and because of need this model has almost become synonymous with the marketplace. Consider, however, its shortcomings for a digital marketplace.

EXTENDED BODY:
Let's revisit Supply and Demand [*](http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp). Demand remains constant in a purely digital market, but what is supply? When selling or trading a digital product, the product itself is both the minimum and maximum on-hand quantity necessary for distribution at any level. Downloading an application from a server does not require multiple copies in queue, like a candy dispenser--the speed by which a digital product is available is equivalent to the speed at which I can copy said file to my personal machine. Nor is there any known limit to how many times that original source file can make a duplicate of itself (though certain protections can be placed to prevent duplication). 

In short, infinite/limitless quantity reduces cost to the compensation of effort to provide it. I do not pay for air ever; I do, however, pay for a way to get air into a certain location: a tire, a canister, a hot room and so on. We have seen that the margin of cost between mass produced and bespoke in providing digital products is diminished, so again we can assume the cost should be somewhat less than the consumer learning to create the product or service herself.

This does not mean that efficiency has become a moot point. The creation of a digital game would be much more resource-intensive for me than it would for Sony Computer Entertainment or Electronic Arts; both of these companies have developed considerable systems to streamline and optimize the game creation process that I do not possess. As it pertains to time and expertise, they have a clear advantage that will recuperate the cost of the several additionally involved hands.

Which leads to the second shortcoming: supply and demand in the traditional sense requires consistency. There is a demand for apples, so I provide apples. When an equal demand for oranges arises, I look to fulfill that request as well. Pears, bananas, kiwi come along and soon I am contemplating what I can provide and what I will provide. That I can provide boysenberries to my consumers--and that they will readily buy--does not mitigate the expense of providing several different types of fruits from several logistically distinct sources. I may ignore a cry for fruit pastries altogether. 

In the same way, a digital provider must be mindful that provisions made for demand do not outstretch the revenue earned from providing. It may cost a digital artisan absolutely nothing to duplicate their product, but how much would it cost to create a version in English? Or in Hindi, which has nearly 80% as many speakers (according to Weber's "The World's 10 Most Influential Languages")? In many cases it will depend on who your target audience is. This, again, takes a very monolithic approach to defining demand.

When we move to something more of a product's functionality than simply the language it uses, we find that defining the audience requires some large-scale generalizations. There is no product in any market that is designed for one specific person; rather, products are designed to have a certain level of value to many people in a very approximate way. Again, consumers are then left to decide if they want something that works specifically for them or costs the same as it does everyone else. With the potential for custom digital products to be much less cost-prohibitive, we create an opportunity for the quantity of supply to be proportional to the quantity for demand at a level of 1:1--a product created for each purpose of each consumer.

Of course, this utopian vision is retarded by the "make do" mentality. Humans balance their daily lives through sundry-yet-intricate compromises, and for the majority of the earth's population, "good enough" is much more reasonable than "exactly right." 

In fact, in many cases, we will see consumers combine objects to create or aid in the creation of the solutions they're actually looking for. This brings us to the final shortcoming of supply and demand: it is based upon supply and demand being independent. The future of the digital world is one where the creator of an object may very well be the sole source of demand for an object, hence making a market pricing irrelevant. Having no intended monetary return, it can be squirreled away as a one-time digital application or can be "discarded" by placing it out where others may partake with no expectation of compensation. 

It is in this latter option that we find the tremendous potential for digital growth.

A few comments:

Supply and demand are always impossible to disentangle when you start digging. After all, my "demand" for an orange comes from my ability to pay for it, which I can only do if I have supplied someone else with something that they have paid me for, which they can only do if they have supplied someone else with something they have been paid for, etc. Even if you're the child of a rich person, your demand ultimately is derived from someone supplying something at some point.

This is even true for the digital world. To read your blog, someone has to have a computer (or smartphone) of some sort, and an internet connection. In order to get those things, someone either has to supply something themselves--oranges or maybe their labor--so that they can pay for them personally, or maybe someone else gave them to the person as a gift--in which case the gift-giver had to supply something at some point to be able to afford to do so.

Once you have the computer and the internet access, though, you can effectively demand content from a vast universe of digital stuff that you don't have to pay a penny for. Get enough of that kind of "demand"--in the form of attention--and advertisers will pay a digital producer for it, or the digital producer will find some other way to make a little money if not a living off of their creations.

But I think you're right that the true charm of the digital era is that someone can create something that satisfies their inner artisan, their desire for self expression, with "no intended monetary return", and the product of that desire will be around for the rest of us to enrich our lives.

I once asked who benefits from the internet, and concluded that it was those who loved art of any kind--including the people who create it.

It's definitely difficult to imagine supply and demand as unrelated, and I'm not sure if they can be separated. In the digital context, supply struggles--what is quantity when one (digital file) equals infinity (via duplication)? I suggest that perhaps demand, being related, struggles as well.

Perhaps supply and demand to not struggle at all, but rather our understanding of them. I grew up in a community that placed high emphasis on learning a trade; it would not only provide a source of income but an ability to create things that perhaps were unaffordable. Brothers could literally build the house they couldn't afford to buy. I suggest that digital products provide a similar opportunity. Remember that the original definition of an artisan is one who is skilled in a trade, not an artist. The internet indeed benefits those who are not afraid to create or modify, and I think my latest post starts down that road.
