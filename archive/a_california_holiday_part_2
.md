	The most impressive thing about the Cali trip was actually the reason why we came. Spending time with family has always been a thing I've enjoyed, though some might say that is in theory rather than practice. I haven't, however, spent this much time with family and family friends with such a negligible amount of irritation. It was a good thing, as we were swamped with people from the moment we stepped in the door (this pic is about an hour or two after reaching the house).<br />
<br />
Though the faces changed, we were very rarely without an entourage to guide us or partake in our discovery of the area. Coming from a small family, I was overwhelmed and grateful for the warm California welcome. And did I mention food?
