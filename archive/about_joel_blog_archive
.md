Young Koreans are wizards when it comes to texting(texting in 한굴 is tons easier as well) and it shows in their speaking.

But is the understanding of efficiency-induced contractions completely absorbed? Here I am writing an entire post about this because leaving a trackback would take the same amount of time as signing up for his commenting system. Go fig.

Either way, other posts have helped to remind me that I could be doing something more constructive, like <a href="http://aboutjoel.com/blog/wp-trackback.php?p=429">putting my newfound language into practice</a>.
