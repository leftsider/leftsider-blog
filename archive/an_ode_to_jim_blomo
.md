<blockquote>A couple months ago, Jim jokingly asked me, "Why don't you ever write about me on your site?" That surprised me and I thought about it for a while. Too often, personal-finance blogs berate people for failing to plan and manage every aspect of their financial future, or only focus on the outlier issues. It's easy to spend every day writing about the things that we're not doing, and I think I've fallen into that trap a little bit. But I want to celebrate the people who have taken the time to set up their accounts right, thought hard about investing and saving, and created an infrastructure so that it actually gets easier over time. That's rich.</blockquote>
