BODY:
Most of the people who are familiar with Korea that I've spoken with invariably ask me if I've been to the public bath (aka: sauna, 찜질방). There are many reasons for this, but it's mostly because it requires being completely naked around complete strangers (who are also naked). Read my experience after the hump.

EXTENDED BODY:
I originally wasn't planning to go to the sauna--a new acquantaince offered to take me out sightseeing. We went to Donghwa-sa on Palgong mountain. The cable cars to the top of the mountains was closed that day, so our plans were cut short. On the way back, we noticed a hotel/hot springs sauna so we decided to go.

Everyone's big on the fact that you're naked around other people, but if you've roughed it or were (un?)fortunate enough to go to camp/gym/boarding school early enough or in another country, you've done that before and it's no big deal. I wasn't worried about being naked at all; hey, we're all naked under our clothes.

The first thing that I have to say is that everything we say comes back to haunt us. I've often scolded family and associates for mentioning that a certain group of people all look the same, arguing that each person has unique features that make them easily recognizeable. I was certain of this principle until my friend disrobed and walked around the corner of the lockerroom. I finished undressing and went around to meet him--only to find that without his clothes and glasses, I had no clue who he was among the dozen Koreans also there.

I took my time walking through in hopes that he would catch me before I passed him. I saw someone squint in my direction and then head towards me....he looked vaugely like the guy I came in with so I headed towards him. Match! We headed out to the showers.

I mentioned that he squinted for a reason. It will become clear later.

First, you shower. They give you some soap and this rag that's rather rough to exfoliate loose skin, I suppose. I was staying close to my companion now, as to not lose him again, and as soon as we finished we hopped into the hot pool.

This is good. It's like what it would feel like if your tub was the size of a swimming pool. I can't remember the last time I was able to have my knees and my shoulders in the water at the same time, so this was a treasure. And supposedly this was 100% pure hot springs water being pumped in. 

After a few minutes there we walked outside (yes out of the building, but in an walled area) to a little building that looked like an igloo. On the contrary, it was a stone oven where we sat and baked in temperatures of 70C (158F)! It was not so comfortable since I had no towel; they had a thatch mat across the floor to sit/lay on but my butt was on fire the whole time. after just a few minutes we headed out.

Here comes the good part. Ouside where was a rock-lined pool which I thought was decoration. We got in! Unbelievably nice, a little warmer than the first pool with more massaging pressure from the water pumping in. This was maybe the highlight of the trip--sitting in unbelievable comfortable hot water while breathing in the cold, crisp fresh air of the mountains. Absolutely amazing.

By this time I was completely digging the place, so when my associate headed for  the next passage way I was right behind him. At each place was a sign, in Korean, that explained what each area was. Since he had taken off his glasses, his vision was quite bad and so he would be inches away from the sign to see what it was. I wasn't trying to stand in the cold and lose my warmth so I started ahead of him as he read. Suddenly he shouted, "Wait! Come back!"

I turned back through the serpentine passageway. "What is it?"

"We can't go there."

"Oh really?" I wondered.

"No. It is men and women together--clothed only!"

Well thank goodness he figured that out in time. Otherwise, I was about to give the ladies a little show!

Instead, we went to a cool-water pool with water that fell from the ceiling, really massaging my shoulder muscles. Then to another hot pool, followed by a shower, the outdoor pool again, another shower, an actual sauna a charcoal room, and a power shower that I must have in my house I build someday.

Finally it was time to go home. Even though there was snow and ice in the parking lot I felt <strong>so warm</strong>. For about 4-5 hours afterwards I was warm like I was sitting in Costa Rica. Finally it wore off and I had to turn the heat up.

Altogether, a wonderful experience. Very relaxing, Very theraputic. I hear that it's common for Korean families to go to the public bath once a week? Maybe I might find a way to fit that into the schedule.
