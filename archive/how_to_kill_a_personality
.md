<blockquote>There must be some lesson to be learned here, about the telephone game. Or about how the fact that any of us can be quoted out of context as public figures at virtually any time. But what I see right now is the depressing reality that everybody can be completely reasonable, and the end result is that nobody is allowed to show the most engaging, interesting and unique parts of their personality. </blockquote>

I can see both sides of the fence here. On one side, a person is dulled down to something nondescript in order to be a representative face of a company, its employees and investors. He loses self in order to speak for many, and that seems to be a loss.

On the other hand, he is speaking for an organization. The organization is an entity, not a spirit or a living thing. It has no characteristics. It cannot emit emotion of any kind. As such, any ideas you have about the personality of a company are solely based upon the personalities of the people you identify as that company. Microsoft is bad because you don't like Bill Gates. Apple is aesthetically inclined and somewhat snobbish. Enron is scandalous. 

No, No, No. All companies listed are simply that--companies. They provide services for a price and generate profit. They are machines. They have no soul, no right/wrong mechanisms. They are no more personable than your toaster is sweet. So any personality or flair that a CEO or PR person shows that endears or repulses you is false if you apply it to the company. 

In the case of this CEO, his comments were pertinent. I don't buy the <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/01/02/that_personalit">spin that Anil later reports of</a>. What he said was accurate, and it revealed a way of thinking in an informal and unpolished manner. If he gets heat for it, he deserves it. When on the record, you speak for your company; not for yourself. This is important for all of us to remember.
