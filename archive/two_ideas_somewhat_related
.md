BODY:
Because I've been <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/10/setbacks_where.htm">doing some work</a> and <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/08/mapmaking.htm">involving myself in projects</a> that have to deal with balancing improvements in aesthetic and usability, I find myself trying to apply the same principles to other areas. Here are two in particular.

<strong>The resume</strong>. In the span of my short life I've seen so much movement and progress. From ditto machines to e-paper. From pocket calculators to smartphones. From tables and forms to AJAX and stylesheets. Am I to believe that the CV has no opportunity for growth whatsoever?

Since I'll be needing to update my information anyway, I'm considering creating something from the ground up. But of course, this type of plan needs to be community driven and based on standards and issues rather than personal styles and agendas. I'd love to hear some thought on this.

<strong>Leftsider</strong>. Duh. I've been looking at certain sites and seeing what I'dd like to add and subtract. I want something similar but with a more friendly, more developed method. Plus, I've been procrastinating about the bad CSS in the archives long enough. heh.

I guess I'll be adding these things to my growing list of things to take care of....I wonder if cleaning my plate off by the end of the year is out of the question?

I guess cleaning off the plate depends if I'm finishing things or just scraping them into the trash. heh.

Well the Typekey issue is now fixed. If you have a Typekey account your commenting can be expedited. Three cheers for progress!
