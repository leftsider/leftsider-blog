<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	One day you're on a touristy jungle island in a t-shirt, and the next day you're in a concrete jungle subway, fully clothed and bundled. Alas, there's nothing really we could do about it. We had to come home sometime.<br />
<br />
So we're back. And seeing that bright smile made it through the travel back (and even still is shining today!) makes me feel good. Perhaps my vacation planning was a success after all. I hope so; I sure did try.<br />
<br />
Thus ends the vacation coverage. You can always see more in my flickr pics, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/frulwinn/">Fru is adding pics to her flickr as well</a>. <br />
<br />
Now back to your boring, graphically sparse, regularly scheduled programming. heh.
