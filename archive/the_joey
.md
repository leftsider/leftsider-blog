Ah, this link makes me think of my dear departed roomate, Joseph Pharo. Joey did everything extreme: Eat a box of waffles, buy a 40" plasma TV <em>ten years ago</em>, use high quality Advent monitor speakers in his work cubicle....stuff like that. He'd drink a two liter of Dr. Pepper in one sitting (even though he was diabetic) and play video games without relent (THPS3 in two days, anyone?). We actually turned his name into a verb:

"Who Joeyed the popcorn?"

"Sorry man, I was watching the first two seasons of CSI straight and couldn't be bothered for dinner. I'll go to Costco tomorrow and buy a pallet!"

Then he would build computers. Computers for every one! And when he finally got around to building one for his own use, it was a scorcher. I remembering asking him, while he was installing the third hard drive--620gb total--"why?"

"I went on a tour of the FBI one time and they said they have a terrabyte (~1,000gigabytes) of information," he said with that glint in his eye. "So I need to have at least that much."

"And what are you going to do with all that space? And two channels of 2gb of RAM? And the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2204,CONTENTID=10628">webcam</a> that looks like the <a href="http://www.popartuk.com/g/l/lgfp1167.jpg">eye of sauron</a>?"

Joey shrugged. "Surf, email, Kazaa, maybe webcam with some girls in Brazil." Money was no object; only capability.

Yes my pal would have loved this nearly $24,000 computer. He'd scoff at it at first, but soon enough he'd be working out pricing. If he was still around, our groceries would probably be ramen noodles and PBJ for the next month while he saved.

If I had the money, I'd most definitely buy this overpriced box o' bolts. And then, with a misty eye, I'd christen it <strong>The Joey</strong>.

Just goes to show that the world is a small place. I'm friends with Joey's brother's wife...we went to college together.
