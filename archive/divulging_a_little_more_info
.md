In light of some of the fantastic things that I'll be wanting to discuss in the near future, I've decided it's time to shed a little more light on who I am professionally and what I do.

I currently work at the <a href="http://www.adventist.org/world_headquarters/index.html.en">General Conference</a>, the world headquarters of the <a href="http://www.adventist.org/">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>. That would mean that yes, I am an Adventist, though that's not really something I hid in the first place. I've worked for the denominational organization for a total of about four or five years altogether; I worked here from 1999 to 2002 in generally clerical or media-related roles. My work with <a href="http://news.adventist.org/data/2002/06/1027445730/index.html.en">an international news show launch piq</a>ued my interest in international media and communication, so I decided to return to academia to gain more expertise in the area.

In 2004, my wife and I went to Korea. Mainly, we went because I was interested in Korean language--a hobby I had taken up--and because my connections with the denominational network allowed us to go as <a href="http://www.sdakorea.org/">missionaries</a> (<a href="http://www.koreasda.org/alumni/alumni.htm?page=8&keyfield=&key=">can you spot us</a>?). My wife taught while I studied. Just before we were scheduled to return, this March, I was offered a job with the organization again. With a bit of trepidation, <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/05/some_of_you_may_not.htm">I accepted</a>. 

I'm working with the <a href="http://www.ministerialassociation.com/">GC Ministerial Association</a>, whose sole purpose is to be a resource of support, aid, guidance and education to pastors and church leaders. While we work very hard to provide for our own, we also provide proffesional growth training for clergy of other denominations as well. I'm involved with this aspect of our resources mainly because of my media experience; our biggest thrust in this area is an annual satellite-broadcast seminar which provides training as well as continuing education credit. If you'd like to see our most recent event, which was held here in Maryland, you can stream the Windows media file from <a href="mms://archived.hopetv.org/atn/2006-preach.wmv">here</a>. Next year's event will be in Cambridge, England.

The bulk of my work right now, however, revolves around a quarterly magazine called Elder's Digest. While the position I initially accepted was more of a lower support role (so I could focus on studies), this keeps me busy enough that they blessed me with the "Assistant Editor" title. Along with the editor, I try to make a useful, easy-to-read, objective resource for the leader who doesn't have a degree in theology, feels comfortable speaking or have all the answers for their church community. I hope to have a website up to link to in the very near future ( another think on my plate....).

At first glance it would seem that these duties have very little to do with what I'm always talking about here. However, I think that these are areas that need this kind of thinking the most. As denominational organization of over 15 million members, there needs to be an equal level of involvement, communication and awareness. Also, the structures to which I point with regularity are things I'm wondering, "Can I implement this? Could this be an asset to my religious social network?"

Because yes, religion is a <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/09/my_network_vehicles.htm">social tool</a>. People gather around it, rally for or against it, live their lives by it. I've acquired a decent network of interesting individuals based on my work here, and am looking for ways that I can include even more great minds and ideas. 

I'm not an evangelist (not for religion anyway. heh) and I don't look at this website as a tool for conversion. My interest is how to connect people. It just so happens that I'd like to do that in as many areas of my living as possible. Perhaps any interest in religious beliefs, principles or explanations would be best left to another method (<a href="mailto:bryan@leftsider.com">direct communication,</a> maybe).

Ok. That long diatribe should prepare you for a few upcoming posts that, regardless of your affiliation, I hope you will find fascinating.
