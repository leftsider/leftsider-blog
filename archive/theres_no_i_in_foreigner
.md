I think the most frustrating aspect of living here in Korea is the fact that no matter how much I develop and grow, it will never be seen in this country.

If we decided to stay for another 10 years in Korea, and at the end of that time I decided to tour the country, I would still be treated the same way that I am treated now--the same way I was treated when I arrived.

Now no one is saying that I have been mistreated. On the contrary, I've been most accomodated sofar. Extra accomodation, however, is not normal; it is given to help smooth over the rough transitions--something that should be well through after such a long period.

Still, if I were to stay ten more years, it would mean ten more years of people staring and commenting/giggling about my differences. It would mean ten more years of waiters bringing me forks when I was proficient with chopsticks even before I came. It would mean that no matter how persistent I was in trying to practice my Korean, someone will always feel the need to clarify what's happening with their bad English.

Deeper still, it means that as a non-Korean foreigner I'm either an English teacher or military personnel. I cannot be an average joe walking down the street. I cannot walk through an apartment building without someone wondering why I'm there. I'm cannot open a mobile phone service plan or sign up to many Korean online music and gaming sites because my residency ID signifies that I am not a citizen. Yes, this is even if I spent ten years living here.

There are few things that infuriate me easier than being guessed. When people assume who I am and what I like and how I think based on nothing more than their perception of all people that look like me or live where I do it makes me respect them less. How can I respect someone who has no interest in who I am? Despite my best attempts, nothing short of becoming president of Korea would make the all Koreans give me a chance to be judged by my actions. Even then, any other person would then be judged by my reputation. 

I refrain from calling it racism or prejudice because I want to believe it's simply the effect of a country newly exposed to the international community. I would hope that the generation after me would find Korea to be much different from the one I know now--the one that doesn't know me.

In Asian culture (particularly "monsoon Asia" which I'm studying this semester) there is a consistent foundation of dedication to the unit--familial, social, corporate and governmental--and its success, even at the sacrifice of personal gain. Individua...
