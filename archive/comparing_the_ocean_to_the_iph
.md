<a title="Helio | Compare AT&T iPhone to Helio Ocean | Devices Chart" href="http://compare.helio.com/?cmpid=KNC-goog-ppc-tsa2">Helio | Compare AT&T iPhone to Helio Ocean | Devices Chart</a>

I heard about this a while ago and avoided it--who wants to see their phone placed in the ring with <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/iphone_observations_probably_p.htm">the most hyped mobile device</a> since the mobile phone itself?--but now that I look at it I'm really glad they did. The Ocean really is feature-packed, and I personally find it to be every bit as fascinating as the Apple offering.

I'm not an iPhone hater. I have <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/top_5_reasons_why_the_iphone_i.htm">more reasons not to get an iPhone</a> than I have reason to pony up the cash, but I recognize it as an exciting new device. Mobile providers have now been challenged to step up their game and support devices that really wow. Mobile device manufacturers now are digging through the R&D dust to unshelve the cool features and designs that were never going to reach the market. And a company that has nothing to do with an industry has turned it on its ear (in the same way it did with portable music--and music for that matter). These are all great things.

I think <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2007/07/links-for-200-8.html">Torrez said it right</a> when he said that the choice between the two is really about personal philosophy. I can support the importance by I can't personally justify the expense. For me, buying two Oceans makes about as much sense and costs roughly the same.

Yes Bryan, occasionally I do peruse your site…and have at last found reason to comment…you talking about “my precious” iPhone. *cue Gollum references*

Am glad you finally decided to look at the comparison, although on a slightly Helio friendly site. Ok…who am I kidding; it was on the Helio site. I guess getting your feet wet is a start, but since you are at water’s edge, take the plunge. And no, I don’t suggest you go to the equally hyped apple page to see their comparisons. Look instead at some nice third party reviews such as:

Fact is I came away knowing a bit more about your phone than previously, and am impressed with the 3gb support and GPS. Sweet. But even still, that’s not enough as there is only one phone to rule them all. THE iPhone. (P.S. talk to me in a few months when I can tell you about a few of the features I don’t like. It will give me some distance on that $599 I coughed up like a fur ball.)
