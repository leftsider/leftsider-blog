BODY:
Well it seems already comment spammers are out and about, but the new system is keeping things in check sofar. Even so, I thought I might spell out the rules for commenting.

The comment system is intended to share your insight with Leftsider and its readers. It is not a website promotional tool so stay on topic otherwise <strong>your comment will never see the light of day</strong>.

I don't have time to delete all your posts that break the rules, so if you err more than twice <strong>your IP will get more censure than Janet Jackson's nipple</strong>.

If for any other reason I am put into a funk by spam comments <strong>I can and will at any time put the hammer on you</strong> by implementing typekey-only commenting. And that settles all.

Any questions? ourdailydead at leftsider dot com
