<blockquote>Mr Johnson wants schools to use the wealth of museums, art galleries and outdoor education centres on their doorsteps and further afield to inspire and motivate pupils.

"Learning outside the classroom should be at the heart of schools' curriculums and ethos," he said.

"Children can gain valuable learning experiences, from going on cultural visits overseas to teachers simply using their school grounds imaginatively.

"Educational visits and out-of-school teaching can bring learning to life by deepening young people's understanding of the environment, history and culture and improving their personal development."</blockquote>

Too bad this guy isn't in the United States. I was talking with a coworker today who said that no international organization should have a North American as CEO if they really want to have an international perspective and direction. While I think this may be a stretch, it is much more likely for a non-American to have experience multiple cultures firsthand. What can we do to change that?
