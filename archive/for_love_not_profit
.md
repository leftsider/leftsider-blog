BODY:
While reading Clay Shirky's second book, "Cognitive Surplus[ * ](http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Surplus-Creativity-Generosity-Connected/dp/1594202532)," I was reminded that source of the word *amateur* is the latin word "to love." Professionals do things for compensation; amateurs do the same things without expectation simply because they're passionate about them.

EXTENDED BODY:
Lately I've resumed fretting about my loose association of lunchtime companions, who are now semi-officially known as GCYP-the GC's Younger People. I worried before about potential stagnation and exclusivity[ * ](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/04/dissatisfaction-as-a-means-to-determination.html), but with those things fairly resolved I now have been faced with resisting political agenda. We've grown to the point that many expect us to champion a cause or push for some initiative or change. They want access to the "master list" so they can encourage the group participate or enlist their support.

But there is no master list. Every single person who associates with GCYP is a person I have eaten lunch with or have gotten to know personally. I don't sell out my friends, and if you can't contact them without GCYP endorsement maybe you should be a little more people-conscious and a little less goal-driven. GCYP is done because of a passion--not for gain. It is an amateur project, and I'd like it to stay that way.

While many seem to make the word amateur a negative word, it is something we should embrace rather than avoid. Amateur means there is no audience as much as potential collaborators. It means there is a much lower barrier to participation and contribution. And it reinforces the concept of doing for the right reasons.

In the Bible, Jesus hand-picked a loose group of associates who he travelled with and taught. His hope was for those people to do the same with others, and he was specific in calling out two brothers vying for top position and one associate whose aim for profit ultimately turned him traitor. The explosion of the Christian church after the death of Jesus happened largely through amateur avenues.

In sharp contrast, much of the negative reputation Christianity receives today is because of the callousness of its professionalism and the lack of *amare* in its amateur efforts. Everyone has an agenda or an end goal when there should be no intent of gain and simply a passion for others.

What are the ramifications for organizations who decide to do things for love, and specifically not for profit?
