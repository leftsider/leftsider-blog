<blockquote>
It seems to me that if you're a designer, a proper designer not someone who learnt Photoshop in between phone calls, then design runs through your veins like Pantone 7418. But more than that, it's there in every aspect of life. You can't stop looking at things through your designer eyes. Everything you do is clouded by this thing that lives inside you.

Now, this is no bad thing. But I'm becoming fascinated by how this thing takes hold of us all and I'd like to share it with you lovely people.</blockquote>

Great post. I passed this along to my graphic design friends and the all were singing its praises. I think it is vitally important to be consumed by at least one passion; have one thing that makes you swoon in bliss or nearly die from its loss or misappropriation. Most people look for that in love, but brilliant people find it in their work.
