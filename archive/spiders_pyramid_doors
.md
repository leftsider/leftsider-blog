Recently I've been battling a bit of depression; perhaps "allowed self-pity" would be a more accurate term. I tend to avoid too much personal meandering here just for the sake of your sanity, but I've really been thinking a lot in this gloom and it does pertain to what I'm studying/talking about in this medium with regularity.

Humans, by nature, are social creatures. My fascinations with social networks is that it is the means by which we are social. But what happens when those networks sour?

Be it sudden realization or a recent bout of paranoia, I've recently felt my value in many of the networks that I'm a part of has been undervalued. People are always asking for my input, seeking my involvement, wanting me to help. Yet many times my advice is not utilized, my efforts meet indifference, and my assistance is not regarded. 

I'm not asking for public appreciation. I am not interested in popularity or in being known. In the last few weeks, I've struggled to rally the collaborators on a project that was set to launch in January; I've created a private, well-poised forum for thought which  has not generated the support that its concept  did; I've accomplished some significant occupational projects that far outstretch my job description; I've been elected by organizational peers to lead a new initiative and had not one attendee at the first meeting called; I've juggled my full-time work and full-time school to maintain some level of interaction with my social acquaintances. None of these things has even seemed to have been noticed by anyone but me.

I picture a pyramid-type diagram when I think of what is now an outdated model of how information and work was distributed and done. In today's method, I think the diagram is more akin to a spider's web--information being received from a number of locations and combined/developed in an exponentially greater number of ways/directions. If I look at my own situation with the self-pitying glasses I'm currently wearing, perhaps I embody the door to the pyramid or the spider in the web, respectively.

The door to the pyramid is the least-marveled element of the structure. While it often determines input/output of information/work into the system, it is generally not listed as a contributor to progress. Additionally, because of its dissimilarity with the methods of its peers--combined with its tendency to be placed in the place which is least necessary to structural support--the door to the pyramid can be easily forgotten altogether.

The spider is the reason why the web exists. It establishes the framework, makes the necessary connections, and bridges gaps and weakening ties. At the moment that connections have been made, the spider is of no importance to the web. the web functions on its own--ideally, for the benefit of the spider. Only fate and time can ultimately tell, however, if the web will work in the spider's favor or not. As one who grew up in a rural environment, I've personally considered the spiderwebs of many a dead/absent spider. 

I like making silly analogies. The problem, however--what keeps me in this negative funk--is how to improve my situation. In both examples, choice is not given to roles played; is this true of our social networks? Do we choose how we want to interact or are our roles given?

If you find you have time, I'd be interested in hearing what your idea of a social network's structure is, how you see your role in it, and what can be don to alter the role once it no longer is effective. Is extrication the only answer?

I like your analogy of social networks as spider webs.  As you say, the spider's work is done once the web is created.  In a perfect world he would sit back and reap the fruit (fly) of his labor.  Until the big, dumb humans come along.  At some point, they realized they weren't capable of creating anything as intricate and beautiful as the spider web, nor are they smart enough to appreciate it's beauty.  Rather than try to gain perspective by studying the work of the spider, they destroy the spider's web.  The destruction is motivated by fear: fear that the spider's web is better than anything they could produce and fear of the spider itself. This fear is prompted by feelings of inadequacy and this is something you nor I can control.  We must make a choice: build another web, alone and with out recognition for our marvelous creation; find a new location for our web, free from the idiot humans who crash blindly through the forest; or cease to exist.

How's that for an analogy?

Not bad man....not bad... :)
I think that it would be sad if our social networks were that similar to the spider's web. We need them to survive, but we can't expect much from them? Interesting. Also, I like the big dumb human parallel, but often times webs are broken by other objects with less of an evil connotation. Maybe this is like a genetic drift?
