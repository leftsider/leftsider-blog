For a minute I wondered why reading this article made me so happy. It's been so long since I've been able to intelligently discuss what matters to me most in this situation.

Many of my friends oppose our involvement in Iraq. Still others have that very patriotic braggadocio that justifies our presence with a mildly swaggering air.

A lot of people that I've met in Korea have a distinct distaste for George Bush. They assert that he loves war, and that being in Iraq is unnecessary. I cannot confirm or deny any of these statements, but I think they are mostly grounded on what people see in the US media that is available to them. I'm sure the high number of America-wary Canadians about don't help the perception much.

But once upon a time, long ago, I felt a little spark of hope in this big, dark heart of mine. I envisioned a people who were free--not in actions or in business, but in philosophy and thought. I hoped that from the developing rubble an opportunity would arise where all people could feel free to embrace their beliefs and be part of a unified collective.

This article reveals that spark again. I'm so happy for the people of Iraq as the move toward their own collective vision of tomorrow--whatever it may be.
