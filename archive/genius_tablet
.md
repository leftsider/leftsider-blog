<blockquote>The G-Note 7100 is a handwriting recognition tablet which, unlike most competing products, doesn't require any special paper. Users can slide any old A4 or letter pad onto the tablet and begin writing freehand notes in either portrait or landscape orientation, and the tablet digitizes the input, processes the handwriting, and lets users offload the stored text to their PC later on. </blockquote>

It's good to see that there are people who refuse to give up on a fusion of digital and analog i/o. Especially since <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/handwriting_the_lost_art.htm">so much can be lost </a>when we abandon one practice for another, I see this as a benefit for all--and at a price that isn't unreasonable.
