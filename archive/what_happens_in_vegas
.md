I woke up this morning to the sound of my phone buzzing. It's the office; 10am is a reasonable time to call in DC, but it's 7am here. I take the call anyway. 

I lay in bed enjoying doing absolutely nothing. My room is awesome; being cooped up here for two days has been a joy. Finally at 8am I get up and take a shower as the huge tub fills. Hot soak for twenty minutes or so... bliss.

After the second shower I don a bathrobe and call for room service. The tray arrives as I'm dressing: muffin, danish, croissant, orange juice and peppermint tea. Read the USA Today as I munch. My head perspires slightly, still reeling from the soak.

The music from my iphone (connected to the alarm clock/ipod dock) shifts from languid to peppy. I empty the drawers of my clothes, throw away excess paper, pack and write this post. Soon it will be off to the airport and back to the pamper-free grind.

Thanks, Vegas, just for this morning. I hope things that happen like this don't stay here, but if it does I'll definitely be back.
