<blockquote>How many homes do you think you need to own to make the list of the top 100 ``home-rich'' people in South Korea?

It's 57. The 100 richest, in terms of the number of homes, had at least 57 units as of August 2005, according to the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs. The top 100 home-rich people have as many as 15,464 housing units in total.</blockquote>
