<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><p>"I once put this question to Jacques Duchesneau (the former head of the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority): say there is a bag with Play-Doh in it and two pens stuck in the Play-Doh. That is `Bombs 101' to a screener. I asked Duchesneau, `What would you do?' And he said, `Evacuate the terminal.' And I said, `Oh. My. God.'</p><p>"Take (Toronto's) Pearson (airport). Do you know how many people are in the terminal at all times? Many thousands. Let's say I'm (doing an evacuation) without panic - which will never happen. But let's say this is the case. How long will it take? Nobody thought about it. I said, `Two days.'"</p><p>A screener at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gurion_International_Airport">Ben Gurion</a> has a pair of better options.</p><p>First, the screening area is surrounded by contoured, blast-proof glass that can contain the detonation of up to 100 kilos of plastic explosive. Only the few dozen people within the screening area need be removed, and only to a point a few metres away.</p><p>Second, all the screening areas contain `bomb boxes.' If a screener spots a suspect bag, he/she is trained to pick it up and place it in the box, which is blast proof. A bomb squad arrives shortly and wheels the box away for further investigation.</p><p>"This is a very small, simple example of how we can simply stop a problem that would cripple one of your airports," Sela said.</p></blockquote>









<p>It boggles my mind that something as <i>international</i> as international terrorism does not evoke a response that is a) standardized across countries, and b) built from the input and training of those most experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, and unfortunately, this is just another example of American error. We defer our power to choose effective options to a figurehead who is no more knowledgeable; then we throw money and resources to establish peace through superior firepower.</p><p>The story of David and Goliath is both our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/11/090511fa_fact_gladwell">bellwether&nbsp;and our solution</a>. And it would seem that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faris_Odeh">rock throwers</a> of the middle east could give us a lesson.</p>
