BODY:
Being the product of a small, minimally educated, rural community, I am naturally fitted with some intrinsic habits and philosophies that govern how I act and react. In general, these hometown character traits are admirable; but for the sake  of progress I've decided it necessary to include them in my occasional self-evaluation processes.

Why? I've discovered that a few of the precepts and tenets which define my being are limiting by nature. In order to surpass expectations, I need to have an open-ended structure; something that can expand or adjust to future development. And, most importantly, creativity grows best when not stiffled.

Boy, do I have stiffling. I'm notoriously enslaved to order and balance. I get lost in the details of homeostasis. I'll eat half a carton of ice cream trying to make it level. I religiously relegate my daily accessories to the same pockets, and then place them in the same locations when I return home. 

Today I decided to study some Korean, but unfortunately I hadn't put my things away; my wife had placed my books in a place of her choosing. Looking for them threw me out of sync, and when I discovered she had taken my pen (or presumably placed it in another location) I was just short of exasperated. I can't study because I'm missing <em>that pen</em>.

I contemplated this issue in my bound book recently:

<blockquote>
Creativity and form do not follow the same path. I pride myself in being a slave to pattern and form, yet I wonder why I cannot be creative--be innovative. I wonder why I can't find the thing that will permanently remove me from this (or any other) rut I'm in.

Well, to get out of a rut there are only two successful courses of action:
<blockquote>
1. Carve an alternate path. Without help from a second party, this is practically an impossibility. No one can really be in a rut AND carve a diverging path. Perhaps that person never really was in a rut.
Lots of people care about me and my wellbeing, but none of them care about me enough to intervene and provide an alternative for something that isn't life-endangering. Even if they did, my analytical arguments would probably deter them anyway.

2.Go airborne. Place a leverage somewhere in your circuit and, next time around, watch it fly. When you're airborne you see all the things that surrounded you from a different perspective...they seem so small. You'll wonder how they ever enamored you.
Problem is, if you're a slave to pattern and form like I, the option is useless. This is the path of creativity, not order. So, not knowing what else to do, you'll simply observe analytically, enjoying the the experience for what it is. Then you'll sink right back into your rut and hopefully forget about the whole experience...because otherwise you're gonna feel really low.</blockquote></blockquote>

This week I read a really great quote by Christopher Morley: "Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, every day, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do. It is bad for the mind to be always part of unanimity."

Now that, my friends, is not country thinking; that's the fertile crescent of creative productivity. So I'm gonna venture out, listen to my music in shuffle, put my cellphone in my right pocket, write with a random pen, dream a new dream, and hopefully combat the stagnation of my system.
