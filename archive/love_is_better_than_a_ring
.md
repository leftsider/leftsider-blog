BODY:
Several things here:

* the suggestion (threat?) of someone that they may get married soon
* the arrival of a ring on the finger of another someone
* the silent removal of an engagement ring on the finger of a third

Well, I can't be more excited than I feel. If someone were to actually ask, "Bryan, how do you feel about this?" I'd say, "Meh."

**Marriage is overblown.** Trust me; I'm a happily married guy, and I know from experience. Allow me to explain.

EXTENDED BODY:
The experience I've had has been one I'd never change, and I hope lasts my lifetime. Fru is all the good things in me, and without her I question their existence. We've been together for over a decade, so the possibility of having a live devoid of her is hard for the imagination to conjure.

That said, two months after we were married we moved to the other side of the globe. A dozen time zones and thousands of miles away from any kind of support, we were forced to rely on each other--which, of course, is what we promised to do in our vows. When we returned a year later, we were inseparable.

**I think that, given the right intentions, and the right environment, any partnership can last a lifetime.** There is nothing fantastical about marriage that makes this happen, for it is only the two people joined can make a marriage work. Those two people can make it work without a marriage license, and often I think those who try that often turn out as good or better.

<div class="zemanta-img mt-image-right" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; display: block; float: right; width: 310px; "><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg/300px-Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg" alt="A Jewish Wedding" width="300" height="280"></a><p class="zemanta-img-attribution" style="font-size:0.8em">Image via <a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p></div>**So why do we get married? I propose two reasons:** societal expectations and religious adherence. We have been trained into thinking that marriage is what two people who love each other do, and also that marriage is a way of saying that we love each other. We also throw around religious tenets and verbiage that an overwhelming majority of the religious--let alone humanity--rarely adheres to. It's all a part of our culture; the myths and symbols that give us boundaries in our living.

So, as I told the person threatening to marry: if that's what you're wanting to do, fine. But do it for the two of you--not for your parents, or for your social circle, or because you're getting older, or because all your friends already have or any other reason. If you're already sleeping together (or even living together) and your life is decidedly secular, marriage is not the reason nor the way to introduce religious tradition to your relationship. Fight the pressure and be happy; it'd be better to live a happy life of questionable morals than to suffer under rules you never truly committed to. **I'll say it again: I'd rather my daughter live with her lover and be happy all her life than to marry for my sake and be miserable--"just ok," even.**

I'd love for all people to feel the relationship more important than the marriage. To the person whose engagement ring silently disappeared: I am more concerned about your feelings and well-being in the loss of a relationship than I am the cancellation of your wedding. *You* are what matters most. I find it a travesty that broken hearts must hide from public exposure when they most need support and reinforcement.

**Finally, to those who have gotten their hearts aligned:** *congratulations.* Continue in the path that you've started: building, and growing, and loving. A medical journey does not end with an M.D., and your journey is nowhere near complete with a wedding. Treat your wedding as "day 0" of the real thing, and you'll help yourself when you're faced with learning experiences later on.

Marriage is overblown. It's being with the one you love for the rest of your life that's awesome.

Now that I've bored you with my attempt at eloquence, something totally different (but important!):

I didn't ask you the ten questions either, so I guess we're doomed to a hateful relationship. Oh no! :P
