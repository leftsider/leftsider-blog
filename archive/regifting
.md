It's great to have good parents, and it's even more applaudable when you can do something similar for those whom you will help to grow. What does it mean for a society when parents no longer look for ways to help their children through their problems? Are we not seeing the effects of this now?

This was written so well, so succinctly, I was tempted to get all emotional about it. I should call my folks and thank them for taking an interest in me.
