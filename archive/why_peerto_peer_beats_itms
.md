<blockquote>And as for competing against Apple? BitTorrent’s strength is that it can offer formats for all devices. He predicts a backlash against Apple’s ‘locked-in’ ecosystem in the next three years. “Apple is a phenomenal company - we’ve hired engineers from Apple and know the calibre of the talent and creativity. Fundamentally Steve Jobs has challenged an entire value chain, whether it’s publishers or the consumer electronics industry. But Apple is only as good as the weakest link because that’s all forged and locked in together. If people stopped wanting iPods because a better piece of hardware came along, the whole thing would fall apart.</blockquote>

Skip the rest of this article unless you are particularly interested--this is all you really need to look at. I can't tell ypu how many people have scowled at my disdain for iPods and ITMS in general. But if they think about it, this statement should shut them up real quick.
