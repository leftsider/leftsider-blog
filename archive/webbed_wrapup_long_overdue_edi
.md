I love this guy. So glad he's bringing his mayhem to the US of A.

No I'm not entering. I've only been a mac user for about three months now, and while that does make me an expert, it doesn't give the general public the time and resources needed to understand he genuis processes I implement in OS X configuration and maintenance.
