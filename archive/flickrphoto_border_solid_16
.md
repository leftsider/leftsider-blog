<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	For my finishing act, I chose to make our last hotel very contemporary and stylish--for the designer in Fru. We stayed in Le Meridian Changi Village, a four star, for roughly $75 a night.<br />
<br />
Very trendy place with a nice layout, rooftop pool, and far away from the hustle of the city. With great aesthetics and peaceful surroundings, I thought this would be the best way to bring Fru's vacation to a rejuvenating end.
