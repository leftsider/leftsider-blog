<blockquote>
We now live in the middle of downtown Seattle in a condo (photo below) that’s less than half the size of our last House.  Our 3,200 square feet of Texas sprawl has been squeezed down to a cosmopolitan 1,200.  We’ve gotten rid of most of our furniture, clothes, and surplus artwork, and all of our meaningless “stuff.”  We’ve chucked the lawnmower and garden tools, and pared our dishes down to enough for only four.  And best of all -– most gloriously of all -– we’ve sold our three cars!

Our everyday lives have changed in every way imaginable.  We don't own a car, so we walk everywhere, including to and from work.  We use the bus or ferry if we want to go farther afield.  This has had a profound effect on how we interact with people.  We realize now that the cocoons of our cars kept us well insulated from the people around us.  Our genuine interactions were with family and coworkers, the only people who saw us stripped of the metal that clothed and protected us.  Our neighbors, we discovered, were virtually strangers.</blockquote>

Something I've been thinking about a lot and have been referring to as "the culture of space." When you are in close proximity to something you are forced to develop a familiarity with it, to understand it better. As a result of its closeness are encouraged to make it more useful and practical in your life. The muscles that you use to interact with things of this type are kept in good form. 

However, when you extricate yourself from something you find undesirable, you are not close to it. You do not learn to deal with it, nor to you find ways to make it practical. The muscles that you use to interact with things of this type eventually atrophy. Succinctly, <strong>avoidance reduces our tolerance levels</strong>.

So it comes as no surprise that when the modern American hangs out with friends, avoids strangers, goes to the local university, marries early, starts working for a large corporation first, buys a house in the suburbs (and later, moves to outside the suburbs), etc....that we naturally are reducing our ability to deal with diversity and conflict. Not only are we less tolerable of it, but we are also <em>incapable of handling and addressing it</em>.

I love this this writer's phrase "the cocoon of our cars." So very fitting. We drive to and from our destinations in solitude, returning to our big spacious homes where everyone and their preferences can be sectioned off by room. Case in point: formal and informal dining areas.

How can we correct poverty and fight crime; how can we build community and address injustices; who will save our cities and direct their growth if we run to the countrysides, spoiling the unspoilt areas. Have we forgotten that everyone dreams of something better? Are we naive enough to think that those who we have left behind would not rather be where we now are?

It is for this reason that I personally feel that choices like this couple made are socially responsible and holistically preferred. Let's become a people again.
