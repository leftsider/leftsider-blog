<blockquote>
China now boasts 162 million Internet users, with 122 million connecting through broadband and another 40 million using dial-up. This places China second only to the United States in the sheer number of Internet users, which has 211 million. Experts predict that China will surpass the U.S. by 2008, or even sooner.</blockquote>

If you didn't have a reason to learn chinese, well you do now. Interesting to note: even the current numbers only total 12% of the Chinese population. That's mind-boggling.
