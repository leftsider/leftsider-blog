BODY:
If you're interested, a letter I just sent to Jim Pharo.

Jim is the father of my roomate, Joey, who died a week after we left. Jim is dying from cancer.

EXTENDED BODY:
Two days ago I happened to be going through some archived conversations and happened across my last conversations from Joey's computer. It was from you and while we were all in bit of a daze, you were doing well: recovering from the hernia operation and happy that there  was regression in the situation with your tongue. I sent a little prayer that things were still ok.

Last night I was told that the issues with your tounge had returned, and that you aren't doing so well. It really hurts to imagine that, even though I know you're a fighter and not one to complain. My friend Cesar told me that Jo had headed down to be with you guys because of your condition, so I know it must be serious.

I never know what to say to anyone for the last time. I guess my problem is that I never want things to end, so I prefer to imagine them as paused. It would seem that I'm fooling myself; these days things disappear so fast and while I'm so far away. I feel a need to pay respects but my heart doesn't want to accept that perhaps this is my final opportunity.

Jim, you've been nothing but admirable to me. I can't say that I know you completely, but you have always shown a patience, intelligence and wit that I have been impressed by. Joey inherited your stubborn kindness; it was one of his most endearing qualities. And he looked up to you, so I do as well.

None of us can control this world, it's effects, or the way it effects us. If we could I'd imagine we'd live as 20 year-olds forever. :) But one thing we do know is He who is more than even time itself. He guarantees that I will see you again--be it in GA, MD, or heaven. I hope to meet you in the latter, with Joey, and catch up on all the things we missed.

My prayers and best wishes to you and your family. May God continue to be in your lives so that we will never truly be apart.

Always,

Bryan
