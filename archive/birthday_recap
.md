Sunday, April 3, was my birthday. 

I usually don't like to do much for my birthdays; the most I'll ask for is a nice dinner. I think it hearkens back to my days as a poor kid who got a card and undershirts; I've learned to notice the love and appreciation in simple gestures, and have started to prefer them.

Generally on my birthday I try to approach the day as normal as possible; it's my time to look at all the things that make up my life--the job, the commute, the tv shows, the friends--and really take a day to be thankful for all of them, since I usually complain about them on any other day. 

This year was no different. Fru had a teacher's retreat the weekend of my birthday so I figured my day'd be spent in meetings and discussion groups. Fortunately, the conference was held at a beachside condo-tel, and out room had a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/8589044/">magnificent view</a>, so I was happy with that. It was the first time at the beach, the first really good spring weather, and I was around a few good friends over here that made it all seem nice. I even spent a little time <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/sets/217509/">at a Buddhist temple</a>, which is becoming a personal pastime.

The next day we visited Seorak Mountain before heading home. After all the climbing and riding everyone was pretty wiped; so I was pretty happy that Tuesday was a holiday--Fru and I could just chill, recoop, and make the most of a 5-day weekend. 

Ji Hoon and Min Jung came over. Min Jung wanted to learn how to make banana bread, and Ji Hoon figured he and I could hang out in the meantime. We went out, saw my student Walter on the way carrying some pizzas. Then we went downtown and checked out cellphones, and we stopped by a table tennis store to buy new paddles(blades) for the youth group. 

On the way home, Ji Hoon sounded concerned when talking to Min Jung on his cellphone. I didn't eavesdrop, but after hanging up he said that she wasn't feeling well and was dizzy. He said that she had been working really hard at another conference that weekend and he wondered if she had overexerted herself. Maybe he'd even take her to the hospital if she was too weak.

I'm starting to get concerned and he's sounding worried. So when we get to the building first thing we ask is, "How's Min Jung?"

Frulwinn says,"I don't know, she's laying down."

I lock the entrance door and make my way up. When I get to the door I see balloons--but only Frulwinn and Min Jung. I'm confused. Is it Ji Hoon's birthday?

"Surprise!!!" 

It was a surprise birthday party. For me! Wow it totally caught me off guard. Especially since my birthday had passed two days earlier. It was totally unnecessary, but after the recent funk I was in, it was totally appreciated.

Some one brought homemade kimbap, another brought a green tea cake. The pizzas that walter was carrying? They were in attendance. And the ping pong paddles? Actually Ji Hoon and Min Jung's gift to me. Yeah I was totally not paying attention. I missed so many clues I can't recount them all.

What's more, I got gifts! Normally I have a big rule that I want no gifts on my birthday; I just want to enjoy my friends and that's it. But now that I'm not with my long-term friends, to receive something from people who have just gotten to know me seemed so special. They weren't big or expensive presents; just small items that said that i was appreciated. I swear my heart felt like it would burst with happiness.

So I'm feelin' pretty good. I really was just hoping to come through April 3 on a positive note since April 2 was Joey's birthday and we've celebrated together the past few times. I must say that things have a way of working out every once in a while, and this time they couldn't have picked a better time.
