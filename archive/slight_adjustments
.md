BODY:
I've made the move to the newest version of <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a>, and the upgrade is not without its share of headache. I've been using MT for over five years, so this is nothing unusual. I've spent over a week trying to determine why this site wont rebuild properly, but I've yet to solve the issue. If you see some problems, definitely let me know.<br /><br />I switched to a <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a> feed some time ago, so those of you reading from the feeds should not have to update your feed URL. You may, however, get a couple repeat posts and such, as I've wiped out and reinstalled the site nearly twenty times in the last 6 days. At very least, I can be happy that my line breaks should now appear in the feed.<br /><br />Finally, the style of Leftsider will change slightly. I'll be using excerpts in the feeds, and extended entries may become more common on the front page. I'll also be writing more intimately and introspectively here than I have most recently; all my other writing will go to a few other blogs, which I'll be naming shortly.<br />
