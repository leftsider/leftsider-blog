	Next we went on a tour which, unbeknownst to me, included feeding monkeys with food we had to purchase. I failed to see the novelty, but I think Frulwinn was amused.<br />
<br />
Growing up in the country, I fed animals. Pets and stuff. But I knew a lot of people who also fed animals. Cows, chickens, pigs, horses, whatever. So feeding an animal just is lost on me. Sorry. Next slide!
