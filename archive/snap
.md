BODY:
I think that most of the people (do I really have more than one visitor?) that read this site do so from RSS. If so, they may not have noticed that I recently added a neat little tool to the site called Snap.

From snap.com, it allows you to preview a link's destination by simply rolling over it. <a href="http://Snap.com">Snap.com</a> used to be a search engine, apparently, but have repurposed their tools for this free applet. I think it's a neat little tool...one that I could really get used to if it became ubiquitous.
