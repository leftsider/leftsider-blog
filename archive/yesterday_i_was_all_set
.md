BODY:
Yesterday I was all set upon being a Californian.

After nearly two years of working and living in San Francisco, I've finally started the process of changing my driver's license. Not that I was very eager to go through the country-wide hassle that is a Department of Motor Vehicles, but because I recently purchased a car. It became necessary for this switch to occur.

I'm not a big fan of California as it regards to motor vehicle administration in general. There's a definite car culture that pervades all but the most urban enclaves (this is not unique to California but is exacerbated by its size). Then there's the fact that traffic citations are ridiculously high: two traffic camera citations for *turning right without a full stop* ended up costing me over $1200.
