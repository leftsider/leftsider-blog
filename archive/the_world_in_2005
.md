Singapore (my new "it" country) beat the United States in this ranking of the world's best. It just missed the top 10. South Korea was way down at position 30....but actually beat Costa Rica(35). What is that??? Mexico and Chile did as well. Hmm.

Anyway, as I haven't spent extended time in Europe, I'm interested in finding out what's so nice about Ireland. Switzerland, sure; but Ireland? Go fig. I guess I'll never know until I visit...
