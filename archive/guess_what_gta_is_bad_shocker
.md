Recently, there seems to be an apparent clamor in the United States over the presence of an easter-egged sex scene in Rockstar Game's cash monster, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Off the top of my head, this is perhaps the stupidest thing I've heard. Let's dissect the news. 

It starts with a game; GTA:SA--quite possibly the game on  the market most unsuitable for young kids. The game is about a gangbanger returning home to help his family gang return to their criminal splendor. In order to do this you must violently suppress and anihilate all pretenders to the throne while doing dirty deeds for crooked cops who framed you for an officer's murder. You beat people for money, screw hookers for health, and juggle girlfriends for perks. This is not Mario folks; there's a reason there's an "M" on the cover.

Now, inside this immoral web of gaming code someone put a sex scene. I must note that there are numerous sex scenes in the story line (hookers, girlfriends, accomplices), but you only hear the scene and are left to use your imagination. In fact, the sex scene in question is also not visible for anyone to see. It can only be made visible by a modification to the game's code which unlocks the bawdy action. In effect that's not even an easter egg; it's more related to a programmer tag--something virtually invisible to the consumer.

So really when you think about it, all the commotion is that when you've tired of robbing, looting, defacing, murdering, counterfiting, and being a public menace you can waste time inserting code which allows you to see some awkward characters act out everything else you've already been doing in the game, albeit blindly. And when you think about it that way, it really is really stupid.

If parents followed the ESRB rating on the front and back of the games their children want, they would already know that this game is intended for people over the age of 17. If this game was only being played by people of that age, this would be a moot point.

By the time I was that age, I had friends who had kids already. A video game sex scene is only a poor reenactment of the goodies already going on. Sure, I don't want a 10-year old watching a gangster tappin' booty either; that's why I don't buy them mature games. 

And if it's already a mature game where they're already virtually breaking laws, murdering people, and being a moral void, why complain about having sex? That's actually LEGAL; almost everything else you're doing in the game is not.

Some people have too much time on their hands and on their private parts to realize that they are making fools of themselves. Their soapbox is sitting on the backs of every reasonable standard, which they conveniently ignore in order to focus on the sensational. I'm really rather sad that this is even an issue.
