Note to self: Read Joel Stein's columns. I don't know who this guy is, but between this article and the previous one in which he <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-stein24jan24,0,1803125.column?coll=la-news-comment">announces his lack of support for troops</a>, he's a very popular guy now. Or infamous; take your pick.

BTW, I've been saying what he is <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/07/guess_what_gta.htm">for quite some time now</a>.
