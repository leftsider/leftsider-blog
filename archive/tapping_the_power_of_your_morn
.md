<blockquote>Steve Murphy, CEO of publishing company Rodale, says, "A line in a William Blake poem inspired me to think differently about my day: â€˜Think in the morning, act in the noon, read in the evening, and sleep at night.' This has made a huge difference in my life. Now, I take out a yellow pad every morning and write my thoughts for the day, which allows me to be much more strategic and proactive than reactive."</blockquote>

I really like this concept. I'm not sure I can really implement it since I attend classes in the evenings, but the premise seems ideal.

There is a lot to this.  I do my best thinking in the shower, which is why my wife yells at me for taking a 45 minute shower, leaving her with 30 seconds of luke-warm water.  But I get a lot accomplished!
