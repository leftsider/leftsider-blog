<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	Gray day, rainy, spent mainly in a bus and making/translating chitchat with our group members (largely because that was the extent of my spanish). Tired, largely over it all, I squeezed into the last spot on an overcrowded water taxi so that Fru wouldn't arrive at Bocas alone. I left Tav with his drinking buddy Ramiro at the dock for the next boat.<br />
<br />
I'm staring out at the water. It's overcast but the water is still so clear. Then I spot it: A dolphin jumping out of the water about 20 meters away from our boat.<br />
<br />
This is about the time that I realized that I live a life that could arguably show up on one of those <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR910-cIauE">old American Express commercials</a>. Ten years ago I would have never imagined that I'd purposely spend my birthday traveling in Central America with relatively affluent tourmates, a beautiful wife and so on. I've lived abroad, I can effectively mangle four languages, been on television, been published. Despite how I like to look at it, or how I stack up against others in the United States, I am privileged. And I'm ok with that.^^ <br />
<br />
Here's a tidbit for your next beer/wine/cocktail party (my professor says this at least three times a class): The average monthly income of a <em>Costarricense</em> is US$300. Yeah. I'm privileged.
