<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	I sent out an all-points bulletin letting people know this year about my usual jaunt to the wonderful land of Costa Rica. A lot of people showed interest, but ultimately only one came: Our good friend and cousin Tav. He's down for anything. :)<br />
<br />
We got in Friday, said whats up to some fam, got a hotel, and waited for him to arrive on Saturday. This is just after he arrived--he took a red-eye flight and hadn't slept a wink.
