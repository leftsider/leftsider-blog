I agree with Torrez on this one.

Funny story. My first time ever using a personal computer. I had used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">commodores</a> at school for pacman and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dr-j-and-larry-bird-go-one-on-one">Dr. J vs Larry Bird</a>, but never a computer for private use at home. Wow! The concept! The possibilities!

The object: A frankin(?) dual-floppy PC. If I remember correctly, 16kb of storage, tower style. My father's prized posession--and completely off limits to me and my sister.

Finally I found a reason to get on the machine: school report. Reluctantly, my father acquiesed. Now remember this was all an intricate plot; so I had ulterior motives in play. And that motive was....

Lisa Bonet. Yes she lit a fire in my gradeschool heart and I was determined to find out information on her. My father had put in WordPerfect for Dos (ha!) and, amazingly left me to my own devices. Now was my chance!

I typed: "Who is Lisa Bonet?"

Nothing happened. Darn! there must be more to this info-culling than I anticipated. I tried again. "Who is Lisa Bonet?"

Still nothing. Drat! Oh wait....I forgot to hit enter! Duh?

The sentence I wrote moved down a line. My heart leaped as I waited for information to pour onto the screen, telling me everything a preteen needs to know to win the heart of a 20-something hollywood firecracker. I hit enter a few more times for expidited posterity. 

"Are you almost done?" My father's voice snapped me out of my lull. Crap! I'm here waiting and haven't started writing this report! Ok. now to get this off the screen and start typing....

Somehow I managed to get back up to the top of the screen, but I couldn't figure out how to get down to my typed query,  smackdab in the middle of the screen. So, I kept pushing enter (or was it Return back then?). eventually, all I saw was blue screen. Sweet now let's start.

Imagine my father's joy when he comes to print my report. It went a little something like this:
<li>two blank pages</li>
<li>two pages of report</li>
<li>six blank pages</li>
<li>a page with "Lisa Bonet"</li>
<li>a pate with "Who is Lisa Bonet?"</li>

Remember, this is back in the day when printers were fed peforated piles of paper from a cardboard box. My dad was actually less than pleased.

This is one of the reasons I say that I was made for internet, and internet was made for me. People often wonder how I can work in an office on a computer all day and very happily spend an entire evening doing the same. Simple. I wanted answers from my computer since I was in elementary, and now I have them.

We live in the future. This is my kinda time.
