	To your left you'll see the kitchen. Nothing special, but quite enough for just the two of us. There's also a dining nook that we haven't taken full advantage of--korean living has completely put us off the traditional western dining conventions.<br />

Useless bit of trivia, this apartment is the mirror of the apartment we had before we left for Korea. So in our old apartment this would have been on the right.
