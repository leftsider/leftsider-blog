Today was <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a>, the day where thousands of blogs around the world post about one particular theme. And on this day, the theme is the environment. But what can I say about the environment that you haven't already heard?

<strong>Be deliberate.</strong> Stop doing things because other people tell you. Stop worrying about the environment because thousands of bloggers are telling you to. Don't <em>you</em> care about the environment? For what reasons? If they are not strong enough to convince you, then nothing I or any other blogger will say can help you make long-lasting decisions in support of environmental preservation or restoration.

<strong>Be thorough.</strong> If you're going to champion a cause, do it. 2nd place is not a champion, and, even counting something other than Nobel Prize winner Al Gore as first, you are far from second. Do you think you've done enough because you understood <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>? If you are committed to protecting rainforests you will stop your paper statements, <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/09/14/pdf.html">print to PDF</a> unless necessary. If your thing is global warming, don't be surprised if I ask when you are selling your car, planning to <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/05/off_the_grid_mo_1.php">move off the grid</a> or <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/">what your walk score is</a>. If you don't like cruelty to animals but are not vegetarian... you see my point?

This world is in a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/trust/2015/index.shtml">very sad state</a>. We <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EFDE1E3EF937A25750C0A9629C8B63">suffocate on our excesses</a> while the world crumbles and innocent, unfortunate and <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty/death/">powerless people suffer</a>. YOU are to blame (I'm just as bad, as I'm writing this post on one of four computers in a two-bedroom, three-person apartment). Until we can face that reality, none of this will really change. 

I hope this will encourage you to think seriously about our environment and <a href="http://blogactionday.org/charities">what you can do to help</a>.
