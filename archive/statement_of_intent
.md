BODY:
The other day I was harranguing a friend about a number of irrelevant issues and happened to mention that all these things would make much more sense if he simply read this blog. He replied that he had visited occasionally but that "there was nothing there." More precisely, he had no idea what I was talking about here.

Good point. I've been maintaining Leftsider with varying consistency for over five years now. The site has had numerous faces, and locations, so I'm sure that it's not an exaggeration to say that the topics have changed as well. Even a year ago my topics were mainly about Korea, which has a much smaller part of the picture today. 

So what is Leftsider about right now? Well, my best explanation would be that this blog looks at the history of culture and the future of technology to create a practical philosophy for the present. More than ever, I find that looking at things that have happened around the world give me insight as to what is happening here. And if I follow technology to the future world, I want to have that same human, native, personal practicality to go with it. It covers a lot, but then, how much of a perspective would it be if it wasn't?

So now we've labeled it. Hope you'll find the ride less confusing from here on out.
