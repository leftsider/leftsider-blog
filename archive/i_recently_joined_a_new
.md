BODY:
I recently joined a new social network-like community called <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. I guess I was an easy sell, as I've been looking at moblie telephony's role in society for some time now....<a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/12/clueless_and_co.htm">since Korea</a> at least. <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2006/08/straps_as_indic.html">Points from Jan</a> were also fuel to the fire. So when I heard twitter went live, I signed up.

There was a little bit of trial and error, as Helio wasn't up on the short code, but I can confidently say that Twitter has become a routine of my day. It's interesting posting statuses (statii?) without prompting; I think it has a creative quirkiness that overrides the ego-stroking  you find in many SNSs (social networking systems). The name fits because, to be honest, there's nothing of substance there--but that doesn't stop it from becoming a complex melody of voices.

Perhaps a fitting, tongue-in-cheek slogan would be "As if you care." Not only because we're all posting little nothings about our day, but also because, for possibly the first time, I'm perfectly ok with receiving messages from people I don't know about things I have no involvement in. In fact, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/public_timeline">I look forward to it</a>. Makes  you wonder how important relevancy is to belonging. Or, conversely, how important belonging is to relevancy.

Anyway, if you're interested in twittering with me, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leftsider">feel free</a>.
