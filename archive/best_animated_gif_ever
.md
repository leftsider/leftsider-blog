BODY:
They entitled it "Best Animated Gif Ever 2," but there's no question in my mind this one is not only superior but unmatched. 

/found [here](http://www.animoller.com/2008/05/03/best-animated-gif-ever-2/). Oh how great it is. :D

I think that anytime I feel sad about something I will come to your site in search of this animated gif. It's awesome. I can't help but smile after watching it. And I can't stop watching it.
