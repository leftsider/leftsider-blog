The Korea Times : 'Seoul Citizens Exposed to Highest Cancer Risk'</a>

Twenty-one out of every 1,000 Seoul citizens are likely to suffer from cancer during their life time, the highest risk of cancer among the nation's seven largest cities, due to environmental pollution, a government report said yesterday.

<strong>The southeastern city of Taegu had the second highest cancer risk caused by various environmental pollutants</strong> as 14.2 out of its 1,000 citizens are likely to contract cancer, followed by Ulsan with 4.7 and Inchon with 3.9.
