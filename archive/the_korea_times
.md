The Korea Times : GNP Leader Clad in Unusual 'Combat Uniform' Again</a>

Yet another article today that floors me with a quote--this time one that is so utterly ridiculous it makes me wonder if I really should even bother with Korean media:

"As the opposition leader put on her pants before making crucial political decisions or facing significant events, Parkâ€™s trousers have been considered a symbol of her strong determination."

Her pants are a symbol of her determination. They even go so far as to call her dress slacks "battle gear." I don't kid.
