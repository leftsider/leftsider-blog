BODY:
The last two weeks have been pretty amazing. I haven't really done much new, but I'm planning too--and that's important. 

It's been a while since I've undertaken any new projects. I just haven't felt creative for quite sometime, and I translated that into a subconscious request for leave. Now, unemployed and in a foreign land, I've got so much time and so many sensual stimulations that it's hard for me to not be imaginative. I'm actually having trouble reining in my thoughts.

So, I've directed my wandering wonderings into a specific direction, and I'm happily suprised with the results. I'm thinking feverishly over them, working them through, and watching them grow bigger and bigger. I'm a bit superstitous when it comes to sharing ideas so I'll wait till they're closer to fruition before I spill the details. Just know that the Leftsider wheels are starting to churn once again, and I think we'll all be happy with the results.
