Yesterday I was listening to an old mix from the now defunct Argentinian(?) Electronic music podcast RadioLAE--quite possibly the poorest mix I've heard there but it had a couple epic jems. New to me, this disco song about being a Native American was surprisingly chipper and the vocals quite tremendous. I need to make a note to discover more tracks from this vocalist.

Yes it's campy. Yes it's politically incorrect. Yes, it's disco. But c'mon... are you going to get anything better on this lazy Friday morning? :)
