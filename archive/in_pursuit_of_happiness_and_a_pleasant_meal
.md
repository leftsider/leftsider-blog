<ul class="action-stream-list"><li class="service-icon service-twitter"><span class="entry-content">Leftsider <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/9108098352">tweeted</a>, "At Original Pancake House with James and Nerise. Apparently, Aussies eat pancakes with ice cream and maple syrup! <a href="http://yfrog.com/3lycxmj">http://yfrog.com/3lycxmj</a>"</span></li></ul><br/><br/>

**Not only do they regularly eat pancakes with ice cream,** they do so regularly at a place around Sydney called [Pancakes on the Rocks](http://bit.ly/dvvOa8). Additionally, they consider this *"a very American thing to do."* Fru and I watched in amazement as Nerise poured a polite amount of maple syrup over her special plate.

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/ycxm.jpeg"><img alt="Nerise's Pancakes" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/02/ycxm-thumb-500x375-22.jpeg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

The plate was only partially special because of its unusualness--the waitress told us of a regular customer that was fond of ice cream on pancakes. What made this plate special was it was the last dish on the table--and when we looked into its absence we discovered that a member of the kitchen staff had *run to a nearby grocery* to fulfill our order.

When the waitress heard us mention the oddity of ice cream on pancakes and shared her experience of other customers, she also saw the slight disappointment in Nerise's face that this was not to be expected. **So she took extra initiative to make her customer happy.** In fact, she praised James' choice of the nutella pancakes (her fav), got Nerise exactly what she wanted, accepted my credit card and brought back my receipt (this is a place that is strictly "pay as you exit") and wished us all a happy Valentine's Day with a smile.

*Customer service is about making people happy, as much as is eating waffles and pancakes at Sunday brunch.* Growing up, pancakes were homemade Sunday food, and waffles were a rare occasion--generally where we found ourselves 20 miles away from home and my dad in a cheerful mood. So in many instances (especially when eating out), the **meal is also the pursuit of happiness**.

EXTENDED BODY:
There are a few pancake establishments here on the east, the most famous being, of course, [IHOP](http://bit.ly/afjjun). It wasn't until middle school that I recognized the difference between them--and not until high school until I recognized the the southern stand-by that is [Waffle House](http://bit.ly/c40S5Z). But for me, apart from the great customer service received today at the location walking distance from my house, the best is and will always be the [Original Pancake House](http://bit.ly/97PvwG). It does it because of the pleasant atmosphere that accompanies the happy-making food.

I have this experience with another food establishment--[Silver Diner](http://bit.ly/bs1y1H). I didn't do diners until after high school, and the one all my friends frequented (and worked at) was SD. The fact that they did such a good job at a warm, clean, pleasant environment was driven home when I went to a more "authentic diner." I was afraid to pick up the menu, let a lone order from it.

**In all these things, there is a battle: the battle between *efficiency* and *luxury*. Do you focus on functionality or sensuality? Are we here just to survive or also to enjoy? And do these decisions stop at our personal experience or extend to the experiences we create in others?**

Swinging back to today's experience, today was Nerise's first day in America; she arrived last night from Australia where she and James live. I imagine it's nice to be completely catered to while stuffing your face on your idea of an american meal (whose portions are BIG, as you dreamed but didn't expect). 

Even James, who has been here on research since the beginning of the year, was impressed by the service--and happy to see his wife happy on her first day here. He's been *surviving* these past two months without struggle, but it's nice to *enjoy* a meal with one you love.

And for us: how do we know James? We sat next to him at our church one sabbath and discovered he was staying in our apartment building by himself--subleasing from a friend's friend, with no mobile phone, no tv and no acquaintances besides the people helping him in the lab. So for the past month or so, every weekend has included James as our special guest; this weekend we were happy to add Nerise as if she was as natural a part of our weekend as James has come to feel.

Because it's not just customer service: **life itself is about the pursuit of happiness--and the pursuit of happiness is predicated upon extending happiness into the life of others.** It is unfortunate that businesses have found this for profit purposes before we as a society have found it to our civic benefit.

"life itself is about the pursuit of happinessâ€”and the pursuit of happiness is predicated upon extending happiness into the life of others." this is the best line of the whole article. Amen. *opens eyes, unlocks hands, gets up and off knees to sit on pew* Thanks for church. missed it this weekend ^^
