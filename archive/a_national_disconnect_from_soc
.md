It is with increasing concern that I've noticed the disassociation that people have with their world. 

Tonight, I picked up some blowing across my apartment community's lawn. I passed initially, but turned around to get it. I felt a social responsibility to my neighbors and a fondness for the general upkeep of my complex that was greater than the inconvenience of picking up trash that was not mine. It's not the greatest gesture in the world, and I'd like to think that other would people would do it as well.

Unfortunately, I know this is not the case. In fact, the last time I did this, it was picking up a half-full Coke bottle that stayed in the parking lot a few days. Wait, no; the last time I did it was picking up a bag floating around where the kids play soccer and tag. Why would trash persist, especially in a high-traffic area of a somewhat closed community?

Refuse is not the only example. My church is facing problems of a similar ilk. A few leaders have left for other opportunites and have their fans have followed. Our church budget, dependent upon contribution by a certain number of members, has suffered. But, instead of filling the void and picking up the slack, many have complained about the lack of service being offered and have looked at the weakening budget as an indication that it's time to look elswhere.

Since when has the world become a self-serving, parasitical place? Are we not equally responsible for the fate of our environment, the state of our institutions, and the needs of our communities? Since when did it become a good idea to move out of the city to escape the crime, rather than work on the factors that incite criminal behaviour? Since when did it make more sense to live isolated than to die fighting for equality and civil justice? 

Have we become this bankrupt? Can social networks affect this? Positively or negatively? Where is the root of this moral decay?
