<br /> Trying to find the source of this video... it almost seems as if it was released by Old Spice itself. If those figures are accurate, The Man Your Man Could Smell Like is probably going to be in college marketing textbooks very soon.

**UPDATE:** Actually clicking a couple links took me to the actual [adfreak article](http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2010/08/old-spices-agency-flexes-its-bulging-stats.html) which says it comes from Old Spice agency Wieden + Kennedy. Legit stats! Wow!
