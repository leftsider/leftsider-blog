I initially noticed this post for the attached picture, but the entry itself says quite a bit as well.

As a full-time worker and two credits shy of a full-time student, I find very little time for actual physical interaction with new people, friends and acquaintances. I find that online messaging and social networking systems keep me in touch with not only the friends I've left behind in Korea but also <em>those who are around me now</em>; more than actual physical meetings do, in fact.

You know that you've reached a milestone in ubiquity when you 
use two of these tools to communicate with your boss--whether he's on the other side of the world or <em>on the other side of the wall</em> in his office!

Is it an acceptable alternative? What is lost and what is gained? What more is left for internet-enabled interaction?
