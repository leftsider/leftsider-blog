As in previous years, I've selected a theme for 2015. Most years I've grasped this concept quickly and with little editing, but this time I've had to work a little harder, taking the time to get it right. 

In the later stages of last year, I was nearly certain it would be "Digital Monasticism." I was experiencing a distillation of interests, a sinking of things that were frivolous combined with a increased desire for things of substance, that seemed to be leading to an accepted withdrawal from popular circles. I felt okay with it, though, because of the technological tools that were at my disposal. 

A generation or two ago committing one's self to the pursuit of truth or justice or betterment was an isolating affair; most occupations would take too much resource to allow for your pursuit, and most societal arrangements were too distracting. In this age I am given a laptop, a portable work device, to work on the internet, a globally accessed medium, recognizing that what I do--and am paid well for--can be done anywhere, at anytime. 

For example, I'm in Ireland right now using said machine with no issues. My manager lives here; we usually meet each other regularly via video conferencing. The difference between now and the usual is that we have a few more unscheduled conversations and we get to share a few meals. For me to do my job however, there's little difference if I'm in Dublin, Ireland or Dublin, California--or Dubai, for that matter. 

I also have this Internet. Unlike those of old who sought to understand more fully, I really do have access to a tremendous amound of material that will be useful in the pursuit. My time would be better spent in restricting, rather than procuring, what I'd need to study. And with this trusty old blog I can document my findings. Twitter and Medium, among others, may have some involvement it the publishing process as well.

But in discussion, both conversational and therapeutic, I came to a fork in the proverbial road of my thought: If I had to choose between a clear and concise understanding of truth or a deep and effective understanding of others, which would I choose? The few people I surveyed in this all chose the latter, and I understood their logic. I wondered if I was losing something, something that kept me connected to humanity. I ultimately decided that conservatism would be my approach for now, and that removing myself from the world, being seen only by the works I publish would be more extreme that conservative. 

And so I wrestled with the slogan for 2015. I knew what I wanted, but I needed a new approach. This was more work that I had previously given to the tradition, so it was a bit off-putting. Even so, In fits and spurts, I mulled it over, contemplated the extrication of monasticism from what it was I actually wanted. 

In the meantime, I'd long adopted as a professional motivator one of Twitter's core values: Be Rigorous, Get it Right--and the more I thought of it, the more it really was what I wanted. I wanted to do what it takes to get things right; correcting my perceptions, my actions and [so on ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path).

So this year I'll be taking the time to get it right. I'm already better for the time I've applied thus far.
