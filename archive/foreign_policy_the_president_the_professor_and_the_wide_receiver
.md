BODY:
It's really quite exciting to see the issue of race in Korea getting an international platform like FP. It's really hard to explain to non-Koreans how bad it can be for bi-racial or foreign kids growing up in Korea--but it's especially hard to explain to Koreans how this "pure race" mentality is completely and totally unacceptable outside their world. With the help of stories like these, perhaps things can change.
