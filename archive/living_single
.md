<blockquote>About half of the black men -- 52 percent -- interviewed in a national survey last year said that being married was "very important" to them, slightly more than the percentage of white women who expressed that view. In contrast, only 39 percent of black women placed such a high value on marriage.</blockquote>

I find this kinda interesting, since about 3/4 of the (black) men who approach me with amourous intent- are married themselves. 

Then again, the article doesn't say anything about whether keeping their vows was considered to be as important. Do you have a link to this article? I'd like to read the whole thing.

Ha! Well, CorporateMonkey, I guess it kinda depends where you're being approached. B'more isn't the most chivalrous city, after all....

But you make a fantastic point. Why is marriage "very important"? Is it because it's a societal norm (that can be worked around in ways you've mentioned)? Perhaps the only reason why it's important is that such a perspective is viewed as a positive trait to women.....who can know?

I'd be interested in what your reaction is to the high percentage of propositions from married men. I'd also be interested in knowing what the percentage would be for all men overall and how much higher you felt black men were prone to this situation than other ethnicities.

My reaction varies, depending on how quickly I remember to look for a ring, then follow that up with the "Are you married, do you have a girlfriend?" question. At this point, I can see in their eyes if they're answering truthfully or not.

I used to be... not flattered, but appreciative that I was receiving any attention at all. It was validation that at some point, a single guy would see all these good qualities that the  married ones did, and we'd have a perfect relationship because so many married men told me how they wished their women were more like me/ or that they'd met me sooner! It seemed like a positive endorsement. 

These are mostly men who have known me socially or through work for at least a short period of time. And from what I gather, I display personality traits or interests that their wives lack, or do not subscribe to- so I hear a lot of, "I wish my wife thought like that- you're cool!" So basically, to them, I fill that void. All the insignificant little things that bug them about their women- I am the opposite of. So I'm like 'the antidote' to all the differences they have with 'her'.

At the same time, it is a bit insulting, to consider the fact that they are propositioning me at all means that on some level, they think that there's a chance that I'll go for it- thereby helping them cheat on their wives. So really, they must not think very highly of me as a moral and respectful person, to think that I would be willing to assist them in violating the bond they have with the woman they pledged themselves to. To them, I am someone to be used for pleasure, in accordance with the 'what she doesn't know won't hurt her' guidelines, and dismissed when they feel guilty enough to stop.

As for an ethnic breakdown- can't help you there. I have been hit on/approached by black men exclusively, since 1996.

Exclusive since '96? Again...Baltimore....Heh ok I'll quit with that joke.

I'm very intrigued by the viewpoint of a woman in this instance, mainly because I have only experience it as a man. I'm married (and I actually don't wear a ring, but that's another LONG story) and I have found increasingly that women are not deterred by that fact. 

Quite probably, this may stem from the fact that a high percentage of these women are married themselves. You'd think that because of this they would know better, but instead it seems that, as a result, they know better. This makes a weak-but-well-intentioned guy like me shudder in fear. 

The other thing that intrigues me about this is the chance we hold onto a bit of naive realism about all this; Are we sure that by being propositioned people look at us as the type of person who has a lower value system? Are they even on the same value system? I once had a conversation with a guy who dated a woman and then her daughter. He said the mother was fine with it and said, "At least I know what she's getting [into]." I'm sooooo not on that value system.

If a person is on a different value system than we are, and they (and their spouse, ideally) have a differing standard placed on fidelity in marriage, would it be wrong?

As my "Living Single" post has veered to a slightly different topic in the comments, I thought I'd reincarnate it with another topic I've been discussing recently. Apparently it's put Bryan on blast season, because this story again involves someone...
