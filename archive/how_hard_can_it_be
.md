<blockquote>I’ve been here a long time and I like this country.  I know enough of the language to squeak by if I’m on my own, I probably eat more Korean food than most Koreans, I can get just about anything I need, and 99.999% of the time, life is copacetic and I make it through the day without having the urge to punch someone in the throat because something or someone pisses me off.  Today was one of those .001% days.</blockquote>

Oh yeah. I've <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/03/theres_no_i_in_foreigner.htm">been there</a>; done that. Saddly enough, Nomad has been in Korea a whole lot longer than I was, so you'd think that it'd be a lesser issue. Things to work on.....
