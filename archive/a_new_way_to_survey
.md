BODY:
I've been asked by the church I attend to be director of Young Adult Ministries. I'm not sure how I feel about that, so I suggested that I'd prefer if I could use this capacity to generate data on who young adults are, their interests, values, and concerns; this data I would then hand over to a team of young adults that I'd help to create new and pertinent programming.<br /><br />Wikipedia says that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_%28psychology%29">young adult is between ages 18 and 40</a>. If you know anything about that age group you will know that:<br /><blockquote><ul><li>They are least likely to be at church.</li><li>They are least likely to be at church on time.</li><li>They are least likely to be at church long after the service is done.</li></ul></blockquote>So how do you poll the disillusioned, the disinterested and the easily dispersed? With a novel and portable interview system. <br />

EXTENDED BODY:
I knew that if I narrowed my survey down to about a dozen questions, it could still take 30 minutes per person. I'd be lucky to get 6 people in the 6 weeks I was given to work on the project.&nbsp; I needed a way to hit many people at once, in a way that would catch them no matter where they were. <br /><br />Text Messaging.<br /><br />I don't know one person at my church, high school age or older, that doesn't have a mobile phone (this knowledge is supported by the 2-3 phones that tend to go off every service). What if I just had them send me their answers via SMS? Enter <a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/">PollEverywhere</a>.<br /><br /><div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/leftsider/q9r6/poll-everywhere-simple-text-message-voting"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080703-e3h26n7ckmh29hwcpn84pi72nw.preview.jpg" alt="Poll Everywhere | Simple Text Message Voting" /></a><br /><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>'s <a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a>!</span></div><br />PollEverywhere allows you to receive SMS "votes," which it automagically tabulates in cool little&nbsp; graphs like the one above. It's just like American Idol! It also allows for "free text" responses, which allow for personal answers rather than choosing from a pre-selected set.<br /><br />The novelty and portability qualifications were met, but I still needed a way to get the questions to them--without manually sending SMS to individual mobiles. Luckily, a link showed up at the bottom of my SMS when testing the poll--one for www.41411.com, the same number to which I had cast my vote.<br /><br />The address sends directs you to <a href="http://www.textmarks.com/">TextMarks</a>, a web app which PollEverywhere uses. It allows you to create SMS mailing lists, for lack of a better description. Pick a name, tell your friends to text that name to 41411 and they'll be subscribed to your group.<br /><br /><div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/leftsider/xnr2/textmarks-edit-textmark-youngadult-make-information-accessible-from-any-cell-phone-via-text-messages-coordinate-activities-express-yourself"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080703-gs3kgfbpnjrgsfdakadfq1wnus.preview.jpg" alt="TextMarks - Edit TextMark: 'YOUNGADULT' - Make information accessible from any cell phone - via text messages.

This could be good for coordinating an event or a ton of other group activities (espionage, anyone?).<br /><br />All said, it seems to work out pretty well. As long as you generate a decent sample size, this could be a free, simple and convenient option for creating your own SMS based survey.<br />
