<em>Recently Leftsider met with Bryan Collick, who has just returned to the US after living in Korea since late 2004. this is the second part of the conversation:</em>

<strong>LS: </strong>So are you glad to be back?

<strong>BC:</strong> No, but with explanation.

<strong>LS:</strong> Please do.

<strong>BC:</strong> When I left for Korea, I didn't know what to expect. I had no idea what we were getting into, and we had to face a lot of challenges to come to the level of enjoyment that we did. Coming back, I had the same feeling--it's a good feeling. But unfortunately, nothing new or challenging is here; we literally are "back," with no progress on the homefront. It's a bit disheartening. 

<strong>LS:</strong> Ah, I think I understand. But are you sad because you feel that there's no growth here? Or is it because you're having to come back to that environment?

<strong>BC:</strong> Well I'm a selfish guy; so naturally the latter is very important to me. Still, when you come back to good friends and family, you want the best for them too.

<strong>LS:</strong> So why did you come back?

<strong>BC:</strong> It's my fault. Still dragging along on this higher education thingie. We had to come back to finish that. That's really what made us come back to Maryland, too.

<strong>LS:</strong> So you don't like the DC area either?

<strong>BC:</strong> Oh I love the DC area. But like I said, we're into moving forward; doing something new. But since I'm enrolled at UMUC I kinda need the instate tuition so here we are. 

<strong>LS:</strong> Well apparently there's something left in Korea that you feel you can move forward in.

<strong>BC:</strong> Korea, yeah. Asia, absolutely. And it's easier to get around asia with Korea as a hub than it would be from eastern US. And as you know, I'm studying korean language and have aspirations for chinese. I'd really like to get the full experience as I discover these cultures. 

You know I recently fell in love with Singapore, and our visit in Japan was really nice as well. Then there's still Philippines, China, Taiwan....the list goes on and on. Actually, there's a lot of America I haven't visited too, but right now what's pertinent is that I finish this degree. I'm considering some masters' programs on the west actually, so who knows.

Good luck with your studies (wherever they ultimately lead you).
