Warning, this is a reactionary post.

The problem with being a lover of knowledge is that, as some point, you start to share it. It's actually quite noble and upstanding to share what you've gained, but ultimately people start to become ungrateful. In fact, they come to expect it. This is, without exception, rude.

Recently, people have looked to me for answers without a thread of appreciation. Especially in the area of computers, some people have become impatient and even belligerent as I assist them with THEIR problems, which of are no fault of my own. When I give tech support to a person on an OS I don't use (which means I'm following steps from memory ALONE) and give them multiple solutions which they can't seem to grasp I fail to see how I can be any less at fault. Yet it seems that people are getting more and more demanding of the free service they receive from leftsider.

Yesterday someone who consulted me on buying a mac left an IM message that read: "My powerbook has been at the Apple store for 20 days! APPLE SUCKS!" I can't help but feel a definite LACK of pity for this person. It's a rare day in Daegu when I turn my computer over to anyone else for any type of support. I feel that part of the reasons my computers always do well for me is that I've taken the time to watch them, fix them, listen to them. It's nothing so deep as inanimate objects having spirits or anything, more like a good mechanic knowing his car's needs from the way it sounds. Total understanding eliminates problems.

Moreover, there's a TON of information out there that can be useful. And scads of DIY tutorials and walkthroughs that can further enable you. But I guess it's easier to just bite the hand that feeds. I guess I understand now the woes of customer support reps.

If you happen to be assisted by anyone for any matter, please remember that they are doing you a favor and show them the appropriate amount of appreciation. It really goes a long way.
