BODY:
Last weekend I found out that 명호 (english name: Onyx), the institute's junior pastor, was graduating this week. This surprised me, mostly because prior to this announcement I never even knew he was attending school. Apparently, he finished his studies in December.

For me, a graduation is a very big thing. It's a major accomplishment, and it's the end of one era and the start of a new (and completely insipid) one. 

More importantly, I've started to have a different view of graduations in the last few years. At first I thought they were long and boring. As I grew, they were a great opportunity to people-watch ("people" often meaning "females"). But more recently, as I now have turned the 4-year bachelor program into an 8-year debacle, I look longingly at the caps and gowns, tassels, and diplomas--wondering if, ever, I will experience in the first person.

Anyway, when I asked 명호 when and where his graduation was, he looked surprised. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but he was really floored that I was interested, so I decided to follow through.

EXTENDED BODY:
명호 went to Sahm Yook University, one of the largest Adventist schools in the world and a well-known college in Korea. It's in Seoul area (northern, I think), so I had to take a train to get up there. 

To be honest, I didn't really have the money to take the trip to start out with. But I looked at my options: spend a little extra to make someone's day, or spend nothing and sit at home AGAIN. I got up early and headed off to Dongdaegu Station  to catch the mugunghwa train to Seoul.

The plan was to catch the mugungwha train that left closest to 8am. Since it's a 4-hour train ride, I'd get to Seoul Station around noon--giving me plenty of time to get to Sahm Yook U by 2pm, when the ceremony started. Unfortunately, when I arrived at the station to buy a ticket, the 7:40 train was fully booked. Same for the 8:39. the next available mugungwha train departed at 9:35. 

I had dragged my lazy but out of bed and to a train station practically before the sun had come up, so I was determined not to be undermined by a late train. I whipped out the American Express (a secret joy--you should see the double-takes I get sometimes) and bought a KTX ticket to depart at 8:02.

Now the KTX is the shizzlee my nizzlee. I rode it back from Seoul last week and that sucker moves. There are little TVs that show in-flight(ha) programming--with a little indicator of how fast you're going in the upper corner. This morning I happened to glance up at that see a whopping 301.5km/hr. That's hovering in the 200mph range, according to my shoddy conversion. Bad math or not, I that train turned a 4-hour commute into a 98-minute nap. BAM! I'm in Seoul, baby. 9:40am.

Well, I still had the key from the guest house that I had used during the botched Thailand trip, so I decided to drop that off and pay the tab. It just so happened that they would know exactly where SYU was--and I hadn't the foggiest.

Took care of business, headed out. They told me by the bus I took it would be about 45 minutes. Thank goodness half the bus was getting off at Sahm Yook when we got there 20 munites later or I would have ended up in the boonies somewhere. 

By 11 the entrance was already packed with visitors, cars and people selling flowers, balloons and gifts. I walked through the gate and immediately heard my name--It was Onyx! Freakishly, he had come by early to check on his cap and gown and just happened to see me on his way back home. He invited me over, so I obliged.

When in Seoul, he stays with his sister and her husband. They live on the fourth floor of an older apartment building, to say it nicely. Granted, the pad was probably right in my budget range even though in the US the building probably wouldn't even pass inspection. Still I cherished it, and told them so, because this was the first time I had been to someone's house in Korea (excepting Dean of Academics Randy Barlow's, but he's from the states so his house isn't Korean). They were probably mortified by this, but I was honored.

명호's mom arrived shortly after, with goodies and kisses for her baby boy. Everyone talked to me with Onyx as translator, even though everyone but his mom spoke some English. We enjoyed each other's company for a bit, then headed to the graduation.

Man, there were a lot of people there. Probably the largest event I've been to here. I wanted so badly to take pictures, but I didn't want to be led into temptation. You see, my natural modus operandi is to take pictures of the things that catch my eye, and maybe take pictures with them too. Well, when on a college campus, the things that catch your eyes aren't foliage. And so, get thee behind me satan get thee away.....I can't have anything to do with your after Oct 2004. 

I did take some pics of Onyx and his family, though. And one with his girl hahaha(hey she asked, not me.) They'll be up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/">Flickr</a> soon. 

Well the program was pretty boring, but mostly because it was 110% in Korean. At least I could sing along with the songs. It wasn't that long anyway.

Afterwards, his family went out to eat and we had a good time. Shortly after it was time to head back to Daegu--work tomorrow, for Onyx at least. heh.

I'm actually writing this on the mugunghwa train back to Dongdaegu, which is the next stop. 명호 is next to me reading. All said it was a good trip. Now it's time to call it a night. Later!
