Haven't linked to any design recently, and this wrap-up had so many interesting items that I couldn't pick which one to show. That's a good week! :)

Forgive me for giving you links that are nearly a month old, but that's just about how far back I am in my reader. I have all intention to make significant progress in this matter over the weekend, when I catch up on the other things that are behind (largely because of my recent energyless depression), like schoolwork and side projects. 

No sleep till Brooklyn for me!
