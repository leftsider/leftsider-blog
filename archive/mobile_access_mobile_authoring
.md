<blockquote>It is intriguing, and challenging, to think about the divergences over time of content creation and use between large-screen devices, and hand-sized portable ones. I am a huge mobile advocate (although I am resisting the iPhone and am determined to sit tight with my Nokia N80), and I have to believe that the mobile is increasingly going to be joystick and pen, a lens to both record the world and capture our thoughts.</blockquote>
