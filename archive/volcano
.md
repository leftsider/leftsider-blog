	Next stop was the volcano at Poas. When I think volcano, I think black rock, red lava, and searing, painful heat. What I got was paved road, a crater, acool breeze and the smell of eggs(sulfur).<br />
<br />
The clouds to the left covered the crater about 5 minutes after I took this photo. They say Costa Rica's 130 active volcanoes are covered about 70% of the time, so I guess we were lucky.
