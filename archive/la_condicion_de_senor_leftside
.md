BODY:
Ok so since it's been a while, there have been quite a few changes in my status, location, and modus operandi. I'm assuming you know that I'm no longer in the US. if not (or if you're just nosy), read on.

EXTENDED BODY:
In three months so much has changed. 

I ran aground while trying to resolve the comment spam issue, somehow completely locking myself out of my website and not really knowing how to fix it. I was already in the market for some new, cheaper webspaces, so I took the opportunity to get a new host and to start afresh. That was not without its own installation issues, and I had a really hard time as well as a lot of procrastination and avoidance. Finally, I bit the bullet and painfully hammered it into submission (with the help of a long-neglected book, Webmaster in a Nutshell). Hopefully soon I'll have the old stuff imported into the new space, and then finally get rid of that old host that, while wonderful, was way overpriced.

Shortly after the lack of posting began, Fru and I also started looking seriously at going to Korea. we started getting our stuff together, contacting the required persons, and faxing, calling, mailing, everything. It came down to the last week, but we were both approved to go to South Korea. We were amped!

To prepare for the trip, I started looking for a new computer. Yes, I know that this sounds like an excuse for a geek to get a gadget. However, the plan was for me to teach and take classes so that I could finish my degree. Since we had no idea where we would be and how far I'd have to go to get an internet connection, the best solution would be a laptop. Since I'm very economical and always looking for the best bang for the buck, I went ahead and bought an Apple iBook in early December.

That's right folks, I switched (computer-related only!) and I'm almost happy about it. The Apple OS X is a fantastic operating system--arguably the best ever--and I swallowed my hatred of all things popular-for-design and snooty in order to have the best. Also, since Fru is a Mac user and we'd be far, far away from anyone we knew who was versed in Mac, I took it upon myself to take one for the team and become tech support.

Now don't think I've turned my back on my Windows roots; I'm still running XP Pro Service Pack 2. That's right; on the iBook. I'm still doing tech support for the fam using that slick MSN remote desktop because I was fortunate enough to have a friend who works for MS that gave me both VirtualPC for Mac and XP SP2 as a going away present for an unheard of 2-digit dollar price. So technically, intstead of switching, I've just added two OSs--OS X and Unix (upon which X runs). So who's 1337 now? That's what I thought, l4m3rz.

Back to relocation. We really waited until the last minute to get ready to go because it was all so surreal. When we did get going it was full blast, all-out, no holds barred--and, predictably, short. We left stuff in the apartment for Joey to care for and the place was not as neat as we would have liked. In restrospect, I'm regretful for that, but I'm getting ahead of myself. We left Dulles airport via the big metal bird at 6am, the day after Christmas. We have been residing in South Korea since December 27th.

I had sold my turntables on Ebay (a story you'll hear soon enough) and asked Joey to send them for me as well as be around for some church members who would pick up some furniture we left. I was concerned about the first few days that Joey'd be home alone, so I made a point of keeping in contact with him. When the dialog dropped of after a couple days, I assumed he was in a funk and would be back on soon. Then worry set in. I asked friends to check in on him, only to find out that he was found dead in the apartment of an apparent diabetic coma. I won't go into the details, but I'm very sad about that on so many levels. Maybe one day I'll go down that road--or maybe not since it's still so surreal even now, since were so far away--but no questions until then. I'll always have a spot in my heart for the JAP.

So now you're pretty close to up to date, and for all the things you're lacking you can check out my Flickr pics of Korea (which are growing like gangbusters!). Or, you could drop me a line and see how I'm doing! Would that hurt you so much to show that you cared? I tell ya.
