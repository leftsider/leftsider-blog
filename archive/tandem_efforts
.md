This morning is the second morning that <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">Frulwinn</a> came running with me. There are a couple reasons why I think this is fantastic--and worth reporting.

The first and most pertinent reason is that Fru loves sleep. Love is not an overstatement here. On more than one occasion we have discussed her affinity for sleep and whether or not it rivals her affinity for me, her husband. I go to run around 5:30 in the morning, and that means a serious sacrifice on her part. For that alone, I'm impressed.

Another thing is that she's a bad runner. I'm a par runner, but I'm a great pacesetter; that's bad for a bad runner. We tried running together before back in Berwyn Heights but the hilly terrain had me practically running circles around her. This time, on a simple flat course, I started from the very beginning pointing out important techniques and she complied with real sincerity.

This second run I could see so much improvement. I'm still practically running in place on her behalf, but she has almost completely adopted my tempo (which I did not alter). This means that now all we have to do is stretch out her stride and she's ready to run*.

Frulwinn is a real athlete, for more capable of these things than I am. I wince a little when I see her adopt new things and develop skill so rapidly. But I'm happy to see her progress as a progress of my own. And I'm eager to find a reason to play catch-up. 


*As opposed to jogging, which I friggin' hate.
