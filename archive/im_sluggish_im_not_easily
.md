I'm sluggish. I'm not easily excited. I'm sleeping a lot more (and, subsequently, surfing a lot less). I can't seem to get up to full speed. My mind is constantly cloudy for no apparent reason. My theory? Ironically, I think I may be experiencing culture shock.

Before I went to Korea I read a book about differences in culture and etiquette between the two countries. One thing it noted is that it can be detrimental to push yourself too hard; you are encountering a new world, and even at the subconscious level you're already working on overtime. The signs around you, the people talking as you pass--all that your mind would have recognized subconsciously in  your country, now it's having to acquaint itself with something uncharted. They said this to make you aware that even though you feel like you're lagging behind,  you're really going 100%.

That's kinda how I feel here. Even though I clearly understand every word on a sign or most going past me (there's a lot of different languages going on around here), there's still the fact that no one here understands anything that I've done in the past year. A month ago, everything I was doing made sense to everyone; now it's so hard to explain.

Friday my father was nice enough to suggest eating at a Korean restuarant. The food was okay, but what got me was that we all ate separately. Everyone relegated their eating to their own plate. Even the gochu pajeon! That dish made me....homesick(?), thinking about all the good times I went out with friends and acquaintances at places like Mu Dae Po (sorry, no korean fonts at work yet).

I say I need to stop thinking so much about Korea, but the more I try to ignore it the sadder I get. Some might call it Hostage Syndrome :P I think <a title="when blah became boring" href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">Fru is feeling a bit of it too</a>; she said she's been spending time looking though old photos since she's been back.

I'm not sure what I want to do now. I hope this rough patch will be done with soon. If anyone has any suggestions, let a brother know.
