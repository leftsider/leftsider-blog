This is a pretty good idea! I think I can see a better use for it though...

I can totally see this bringing usefulness to these lcd screens they keep trying to implement on new refrigerators. I open the door, look for what I have, and then the refigerator makes suggestions regarding creatable meals. Now that's useful!

Businesswo-mom comes home from a hard day and now can have a quick list of fast recipies. Bachelorette Betty can impress her unexpected guest with a meal she "just whipped up with what was there." Bonus points for health-friendly indicators. 

Any other ideas?
