While we're on things I'll regret when I return to the States. Um, hate to rain on your parade, but here in Korea I can charge my (korean)Motorola with almost any charger.

Mas, I can run into many convenience stores and get a quick 10 minute charge when my battery dies. For a small fee, of course, but when you need the call....

This is the second post today where I feel like responding to Gizmodo. I now realize; I need to be a commenter. Anyone have an invite?
