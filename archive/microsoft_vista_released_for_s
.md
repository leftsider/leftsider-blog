I had the opportunity to play with this (and office 2007! wow!) last week and I was just floored. Despite the fact that it's late, it's feature-stripped, and, well, it's Microsoft, this is a BEAST of an OS. 

Unless those things that Jobs "kept secret" about Lepoard are really, really, fantastic (note to self: why haven't I played with lepoard yet?), I see Vista and Lepoard to be largely on the same playing field. 

This really makes no difference however. I still say buy a mac. Hardware supports both OS, and both Apple and MS will say "Thanks for buying!" It's a win-win-win(you) situation.
