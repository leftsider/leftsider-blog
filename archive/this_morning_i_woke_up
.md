This morning I woke up feeling like someone beat and bruised me. I felt a little better shortly after getting up, but I couldn't generate energy. 

I went to work late and left early. Now I've got unfinished tasks, hours to make up and an exam tomorrow. Nyah well; I work best under pressure. Actually, I think I work ONLY under pressure. heh.
