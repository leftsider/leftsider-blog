BODY:
A couple days ago I successfully upgraded the RAM in my iBook to its maximum, 1.25gb. I was really nervous about this, because I had never upgraded ram (ok maybe once) and never worked on laptop hardware. Since my iBook is my lifeline these days, I was very pensive.

Additionally, I used my bad korean speaking ability to order the RAM from a questionable Mac service center for a ridiculously low price. When I came back to pick up my order, the memory was givent to me, folded in a square of aluminum foil with a handwritten receipt. I was sure of impending doom, so I named the post iBotched--as in my botched attempt to upgrade my computer.

Surprisingly, though, everything when smoothly. Even though the numbers on my stick of RAM were far from identical to the ones listed in the recommendations in my manual, they were almost a match to the ones on the stick I was replacing. And the whole operation took a record 15 minutes--not including my going back to make sure I hadn't missed anything.

So I've decided to rename this operation iBump, in reference to both the bump up in speed and the mountain that I made out of a molehill.
