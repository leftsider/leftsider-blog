I think, like [Jodi](http://eastwestpage.wordpress.com/), my initial feeling about this is "yet another nutjob... and why is the media making note of this?"

But by removing the religious extremist element from the picture, I find myself really admiring this guy's courage and willingness to sacrifice himself for change--something that [I've written about before](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/02/protest-in-the-age-of-detached.html). His action, in this light, is the epitome of true protest.

**So here's something to ponder:** *How many Korean Americans (nutjob or otherwise) would it take to do this before it influenced the situation in any way whatsoever?* How many Korean Americans would need to go before it was picked up (and most likely supported) by those protest-loving South Korean activists? How many South Korean and Korean American activists would it take before North Korea was forced to respond--even if the US or South Korea did not?
