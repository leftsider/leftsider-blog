I've been talking a lot recently about people connecting, being together, being apart.....but I haven't really put my info out there so that people can be in touch with me.

So, here you go; the vehicles for my social network:

My status: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leftsider">Twitter</a>
My thoughts: <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider">Leftsider</a> (duh)
My music: <a href="http://last.fm/user/leftsider">Last.fm</a>
My photos: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider">Flickr</a>
My Korean side: <a href="http://www.cyworld.com/leftsider">Cyworld</a>
My links: <a href="http://del.icio.us/leftsider">del.icio.us</a>
My chat: Gtalk (can you guess my username?)

I'm still pensive about sharing MY social network systems with the public...and <a href="http://dumblittleman.blogspot.com/2006/09/how-to-get-robbed-killed-or-stalked-by.html">with just cause</a>.  But I guess I need to put my money where my mouth is...seeing as <a href="http://joi.ito.com">bigger sites</a> and more notable social web apologists are <a href="http://beta.plazes.com/user/JoiIto">doing no less</a>.

What are the elemental "sticks and glue" that make an SNS? Living beings and the things that they bond around! So the thing about social networking systems is that, in my opinion, they encompass so much more than a site you contact your friends on. SNSs have been around as long as there were people needing to connect. 

It's something you do to fit in; something you use to stay in touch. It's a social lubricant and a relationship tool. It can be a drink in a bar, a campus bulletin board, dogs sniffing each other....like I said: all you need are living beings and something that builds a bond! :)

So what makes it so dangerous online? In every SNS there is a need for a certain level of security. There are people who take advantage of the church potluck and people who manipulate through Myspace pages. In every ideal community, we encounter those who have less lofty agendas. So, we learn to act and adapt accordingly. 

So whether I'm sharing my info here, starting a business in second life, or reaching out to intelligent life in the galaxy, I do so with best intentions--despite a proven knowledge of the intentions of others--and hope to further understand the profitability and pitfalls of SNSs.
