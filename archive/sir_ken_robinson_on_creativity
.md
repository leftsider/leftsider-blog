UPDATE: I spent the whole day talking about this presentation, but I never got around to discussing it here. So here's the comment a full day after I posted. Apologies.

I've been thinking about this ever since I read that article about <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/03/the_power_of_praise.htm">the power of praise</a>. Even before I listened to this rather entertaining visionary presentation, I have been thinking of how to shift my state of being from one dependent upon inherent skill to one that gives full effort without reserve. It's tough, and I'm not sure of any system created to address this for adults. Is our best hope, then, is that the development of those entering education now will be such that their creativity and innovation can help us, the aged, in the future?
