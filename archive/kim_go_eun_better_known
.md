Kim Go Eun, better known as <a title="Artist of the week - Byul - soompi.com" href="http://soompi.com/?q=node/473">Byul</a> (the Korean word for 'star'), recently released her third album, 눈물샘.

I didn't initially know it as 눈물샘, because someone gave the album to me digitally and the korean got corrupted. When I went to YesAsia to find the album title, they said the title was "<a href="http://us.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/aid-50515/section-music/code-k/version-all/pid-1004116751/">Lachrymal Glands</a>."

A quick look to google explained <a href="http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab11/Eye/EXAMPLES/EXTRGLND.HTM">what lachrymal glands are</a>.....and a quick use of its language tool translated 눈물샘 somewhat more accurately as "a tear spring." As realization set in, so did the humor.

Now that I'm thinking about it, though, I'm not sure how that could be aptly translated in English. The source of my tears? Tear wells? Tear ducts have no real marketability, and  lachrymal glands sounds like medical research more than it does a ballad album.
