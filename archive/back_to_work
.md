Had a not-bad time this weekend at Jiri mountain; got a surprising amount of time to sit and think about a few things, which was nice. Now that I'm back though, it's business as (recently) unusual.

Got a request to do some print design (?) and I agreed (???). Typical of someone who asks me to do something I have never advertised an expertise in, they need about 100 pages of content completely reformated. In 10 days. The project was mailed to me Friday afternoon, and man was it ugly. 

So I'm starting on that. Knocked out about 20% last night; I'll try and do more today. Ultimately I'm just playing wage slave and doing all the dirty work while I get Fru (the REAL print designer) to make a layout design that I'll deal with applying to all the content. We'll see how it goes.

Even so, I'm going to still try and keep up with posting. I need to. I'm obligated to. If I don't, a 3-legged gorilla will shoot rubberbands at me. 

I think it's time for my medication. Cheers till next time. =o]
