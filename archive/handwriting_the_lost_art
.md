<blockquote>Stacked up against teaching technology, foreign languages and the material on standardized tests, penmanship instruction seems a relic, teachers across the region say. But academics who specialize in writing acquisition argue that it's important cognitively, pointing to research that shows children without proficient handwriting skills produce simpler, shorter compositions, from the earliest grades.

Scholars who study original documents say the demise of handwriting will diminish the power and accuracy of future historical research. And others simply lament the loss of handwritten communication for its beauty, individualism and intimacy.</blockquote>

I used to often say that if I were kind of the world, I would do everything digitally and use paper only for calligraphy, poetry, music writing, and such. While I recognized the romance inherent in hand-writing, I didn't associate it completely with creative thought.

Just last week one of the associate directors noted (very audibly) my handwriting during a staff meeting. I was fortunate enough (though at the time felt quite UNfortunate) to attend a elementary school that focused considerably on handwriting. During my formative years, handwriting and oration were really force-fed to us, and most of the people who did well in those area did seem to excel more in their studies overall.

Are we losing a cultural and expressive treasure as we hurtle headlong into technological efficiency? There have been arguments in China regarding the losses incurred from the adoption of simplified Chinese; there have been laments in Korea about the declination of literacy due to less Chinese character usage and unchecked adoption of foreign words. Could this be America's equivalent?

Coincidentally, I think this really fits with the cute post below.

My sister once won the World Handwriting Contest, a misnomer if I ever saw one (the contest name, I mean).

It's an irony that the World Handwriting Contest has what is possibly the world's worst contest website, complete with tiling background image, bad links and the page that just won't quit.

Even so, I looked through the entries. Some of them are simply fantastic. I think, with a little refreshing, I could compete, though.
