	We arrived in Glendale Sunday afternoon.</p><p class="flickr-yourcomment">Remember Tav (right), who <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/04/dsc00144.htm">came with us on our Costa Rica/Panama trip</a>? He was in Irvine, so we all drove down there to meet up with him and his siblings--along with Fru's cousin Karen who flew in from Vancouver. <br />
<br />
The gang decided on Lucille's Barbecue Grill for an eating spot; I was stuck with the side dishes that came with the family meal they ordered. :/
