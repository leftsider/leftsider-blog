Well. What can you say about this? It's increasingly apparent that <strong>social networks, when exposed to each other, will have negative impacts if only one SN's ethical code is adhered to.</strong> We've got employers reading Myspace, online RPG's potentially blackmailed, <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2006/09/08/sex_bait.shtml">Craiglist responses put on blast</a>....each is an example of one (or more) set of understood rules being broken.

So how fragile are SN communities? Must there be a perfectly sterile environment to make these things work? Watch these stories; perhaps they will indicate how social networks will adapt and respond to these negative stimuli.
