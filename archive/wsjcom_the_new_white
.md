Oh man this is great. I don't know what makes me like this piece more:
<li>Whites in the minority underachiever role</li>
<li>Whites worried that their child is focusing on test scores more than sports and optional activities</li>
<li>Whites looking for schools witt LOWER test scores</li>

Seriously, the thing just keeps getting better. I gotta say that I love this. 

I have a hard time understanding a logic that condems parents for pushing their kids to be academically stellar--even when they push too hard--yet still looks down on families who don't guide and direct their kids to be responsible and assertive. Where exactly do you stand?

Yes...Yes, I know that I've never posted here--you know it's just not my thing. Fact is though (1) The phone number you gave me is wrong, so we can't reach you and may not see you (as I'm leaving next Saturday 3rd). (2) Couldn't resist posting to your loving response about the decline of the "white man." You'll just never understand how hard it is. (3)wanted to give you the option of calling Sook's mom, to leave us a number you can reach us at xxx.xxxx (yeah right...coward), or email me back. Anyhoo...ltr

Sorry bro...my laziness in site maintenance meant that this comment was stuck in the Junk box. My bad. I'm suprised you'd put a phone number up there, though. I removed it for your mother-in-law's sake. Bad son!
