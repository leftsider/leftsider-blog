This guy is incredible. He's a real inspiration by the way he is able to simply and effectively reinforce a single theme: You are responsible for your financial environment, and doing so does not need to be exceedingly complex. It only needs to be deliberate.

I've been going on for the past two weeks in conversational ramblings that have revolved around a few key words: deliberacy, perception, and purpose. How many of us really live are lives in a way that can truly incorporate these ideals? If so, we'd find as Ramit has that there everything about living is connected and reference-capable.

Anyway, he's got a little booklet he's selling. I might just buy it as paybacks for all the information he's given thus far. Definitely worth checking.
