This article is mildly interesting, especially if you are interested in property right now. The real reason I give it some note here is because of this absolute atrocity of an analogy here: 
<blockquote>
Like worms that surface after a torrential rain, revelations that emerge when an asset bubble bursts are often unattractive, involving dubious industry practices and even fraud. In the coming weeks, some mortgage market participants predict, investors will learn not only how lax real estate lending standards became, but also how hard to value these opaque securities are and how easy their values are to prop up</blockquote>

I don't know how that passed the editors. It should be added to my list of other <a href="http://writingenglish.wordpress.com/2006/09/12/the-25-funniest-analogies-collected-by-high-school-english-teachers/">analogy favorites</a>.
