Oh my goofy gulai I want one of these. Lately I've been doing a lot of reading digitally....mostly technical books but occasionally something of interest to most of you. I've become accustomed to using my pda (sideways, in landscape view), but this would be exponentially better.

The only thing that would make it better, which I doubt will ever happen, would be if it supported CHM files.
