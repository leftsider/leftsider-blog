<blockquote>The word "globalization" is used in Korea to the point that it could make your ears bleed. The Korean version of globalization has a passive connotation, given that we normally begin discussing it by saying, "In the globalized era, in order to survive limitless competition..."

That passive understanding of the concept is shattered when you see how many people are engaged in such intense debate inside and outside the summit hall, where the global order is actually being created. I was a little unhappy when I saw not a single Korean among all these people -- the world leaders creating a new world order, NGO workers voicing their views on the policy-making process, college students studying international politics on site and cultivating their own understanding of it all.</blockquote>
