BODY:
I experienced a good bit of mental trauma coming back to the US. I was talking with a friend recently and he noted that my philosophies have changed considerably in the past two years. Now that the dust has settled, I'm starting to realize it myself.

<strong>Socialism vs. Capitalism in the western world.</strong> Before I left, this friend and I were on opposite sides of this topic's spectrum. He believed in a more socialist society. I didn't deny the merit of such a scenario, but noted that it was a theory that required total adherence. Just one person who seeks his own over others could potentially throw the whole thing off--which, I argued, is why there are no successful examples of such a society today. Man is, by nature, a capitalist; therefore it is only this way that can be realistically prescribed.
Now, I still thing that socialist theories are well intentioned but ultimately flawed, and for much the same reason that I did before. However, I no longer think that man is capitalist by nature. Instead, I feel that most people are in a self-induced coma. In this coma, you are not expected to do, feel, think, or act in any way other than what the coma prescribes. The machine moves so smoothly--so efficiently--that it really is more effort to live deliberately. The mass of the population lives to exist as part of the mass, with most people completely unaware of exactly how much choice exists in their life. Of the few who do realize, many choose not to decide to avoid a life of redundant explanation and ostracized social friction. It's all very <a href="http://www.nocents.org/images/featurepics/MatrixArticleImage2.jpg">Matrix-like</a>.
The remaining people--those who realize their ability to live different and choose to do so--are responsible for the direction and provision of structure for the rest of society. Most of these people use this to their own gain and profit; hence, capitalism. I like to think that making people aware of their dormancy should be a requirement; if you choose to avoid deliberacy, however, I feel no guilt providing the services to supply your demand. 
Still pro-capitalism, but from a decidedly different perspective. This is the view that prompted him to express how I've changed.

<strong>Status, Automobiles.</strong> Recently I had a friend who complained to me how he had been hoodwinked by his wife and, as a result, was the proud owner of a BMW X5. He is a BMW enthusiast, but he felt it was unnecessary to take on the payments when his current vehicle was paid for and drove just fine. Less than six months later, however, he is the proud owner of a Porsche Boxster. 
To be honest, I love cars as a status symbol. When I arrive, I want to have a car that lets people know such. Because I feel that all of your things should be indicative of who you are (not who you're aspiring to be), I can't justify a status-symbol car at this point in my life. In fact, the beat-up <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/277261493/">car I currently own</a> is probably quite indicative of my life right now. ha. 
For economical reasons, I am more in favor of public transportation than private, which means that outside of the status symbol realm, a car is largely excessive to me; an expensive car, even more so. As I currently feel that <a href="http://www.leaseguide.com/lease03.htm">I will never own another car for the rest of my life</a>, I cannot help but feel a tinge of sadness that all of these philosophies show how much the paths of my friend and I have diverged.

<strong>Thinking about you thinking about me.</strong> I had some very fun times in my life, and I sort of built a reputation of being a very fortunate fellow. In fact, I was fortunate--perhaps downright lucky--but because of this my life revolved around spin. I knew about <a href="http://www.wallpaper.com/">luxurious things I couldn't afford, places I'd never been to</a>, and made acquaintance with people who were largely out of my league. I had to, in order to maintain my good standing and reputation. It wasn't a bad thing, because I learned so much and enjoyed every minute of it; but as I prepared to really pursue the school thing and go abroad, I found myself retelling the same stories....because my self-extraction from the spin left me with only the inertia to work with.
Today, I'm in contact with very few of my old friends. I'm in little contact with anyone, really, as I focus on work and school. But I'm building spin again. This time, it's self-created; it's the culmination of the ideas I'm brewing, the new things I'm learning, and the application of any(and every-)thing to practical life. Think tanks are du jour; speaking engagements are becoming more common. this time, I'm really looking to move the world and build my reputation on function rather than form.

I feel as if these and other changes are a move forward; I love the idea of being progressive, and I don't want to rest on my current laurels. I want to move forward and see, do, and be more. And like they say: Change is good.
