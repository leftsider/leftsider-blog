I think this is a good idea, especially for fledgling travelwarriors (like me) who do their share, but not enough to earn regular bump-ups. The airline known for the best service consistently seeks out new ways to make a better experience.

I'm most excited by the <em>passenger lounge</em>. Sure they tell you to take time on long trips to stretch and stand, but there's rarely anywhere in economy to accomodate that. What generally happens is an uneasy mingle around the lavatories--people loitering, and people wondering if the loiterers are in line for the bathroom.

Here, there's a space specifically allocated for this, complete with complimentary snacks for social lubricant. Genius; I imagine the atmosphere of the entire cabin improving by this single addition. 

What would you do if you to improve your in-flight environment?
