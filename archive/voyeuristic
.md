<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="writeentry.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/writeentry.jpg" width="500" height="62" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></div>I can't explain how odd it feels to log into the backend of Leftsider, let alone push the big "Write Entry" button. It's been a while, and 2009 currently has no theme upon which a resumation might occur.<div><br /></div><div>Even so, I'm fine--<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">how are you?</span> 2009 has absolutely no reason to be bad, and I hope you're as optimally positioned in spite (or because) of the current forecast of bleakness.</div><div><br /></div><div>And being so poised, I decided to redesign Leftsider. And to reinstate commenting. And to write again. And though I was reasonably happy with the last design, it was a frankenstein of a thing; the new design will be not just standards compliant but 100% MT compatible in naming and element usage. Which is why... it doesn't exist just yet. Â </div><div><br /></div><div>So I decided that I'll do it little by little. Leftsider has always been where I practice my craft, so I'm going to bare my redesign privates, as it were, for everyone to see.</div><div><br /></div><div>As comments are back, feel free to input as I progress. I hope you'll be pleased with the eventual outcome.</div>
