BODY:
For the last 45 minutes or so, Frulwinn has been sitting next to me thinking up ideas for her resume re-design. She's been playing around with a lowercase, serifed, italicized "f" as a logo and theme for the project.

Everything she has come up with is pure genius. Sofar, I've seen about five progessing versions that I would have totally stopped and worked with. Yet she keeps going. And it keeps getting better. Occasionally she'll reference the Illustrator helpfile or an online tutorial for information on doing a certain technique, but the idea is all hers, and she just keeps going.

People with talent disgust me, a no-talent hack.
