BODY:
I was goofing around my grandparent's house, which wasn't actually
their house but the house of the grandparents of some childhood friends
from long ago. I remembered when the neighboring houses were nothing
but fields that we used to play hide and seek in. Running around in the
dark, until I realized that some new resident was washing dishes in the
sink just a few feet away, exposed to me by a kitchen window. <br /><br />I back
away softly while waiting to see their face. It never happens. I turn
to see the ice cream truck that's headed my way on the night street
make a sharp right and drive up the stairs of a cupcake shop; the truck
nimbly makes a 180 turn and drives back down as I wonder if he sells
the cupcakes along with his strawberry shortcake popsicles, which I now
want. I race after him, and decide to give chase as far as it takes. <br /><br />At
the end of the street I must open a door to continue, and there I run
into my grandmother with groceries in her hands. Though I am not
supposed to leave, she is not at all angry (or surprised). She feigns
ignorance as she walks on to wards the house. I set off running again,
though beyond this door there is freezing rain. The ground is slushy
and I slide as if I am ice skating, happy to be free. I think to myself
that I want to twitter, "Running t-shirted in the freezing rain. I feel
like <a href="http://twitter.com/Brad">@brad</a>." I need to revise my wording. <br /><br />I jump in a skip kind of way,
being careful not to slip and fall. The last time I jump too high and
float in to the arms of a medium-sized tree that lines the sidewalks.
Rather than alert the people who were walking in front of me, I jump
again and land on the roof of the nearby building (which I think is
this tire shop I really live by) on the roofs now, with no one to alarm
or disturb, I run and leap and soar at full speed, recklessly. I
realize I'm too high, too fast and as I touch down onto a large
commercial roof I just take off sliding. I slide off the edge onto
another building, and another, until I'm running out of buildings and
approaching a treed neighborhood. I jump at the last building and try
my best preparation to an unwanted land in suburbia. <br /><br />Somehow I land on
a house but inside the house; on a very high ledge where the floor is
far below me and filled with stuffed animals. I contemplate which
plushy item will absorb the sound and impact of my fall, but then I
hear noise. Afraid that the inhabitants have already heard me land, I
quickly drop down as silently as I can and dart to the back door. While
opening and making my way out I realized I can't sprint nearly as long
as I'd want because I just finished running and skipping there. I need
to hide<br /><br /><br />

EXTENDED BODY:
[quickly bryan, it's fading]<br />
<br />
I run two blocks not
turning to look if the people I see are running after me. I hang a left
and then a right at the next block. I see some others running and I
don't have time to see if they're in pursuit, just working not to be
seen by them. I duck up a driveway and fall back on what I think is the
back of the house, squeezing myself low between two large and low
items. These other guys come a'runnin', and they end up in the same
place I am. Their clothes look dated, and they're whoopin' and
hollerin' like they were bandits out old west. A few climb up just in
front of me, and I realized I'm sitting between two tires of an
18-wheeler. They pull off and I can feel the turning wheels catching on
my sleeves <br />
<br />
[protective dreaming? I thought I was t-shirted?]<br />
<br />
The
driver
was wearing a red blindfold over his eyes and was the coolest of
the gang, maybe the leader. I'm looking up at him as if the truck is
made of air and I'm sitting in the engine. He works to keep his
blindfold from falling down, then signals for a cigarette, which he
smokes casually while driving boldly (and blindly). They were singing a
song that had the same spirit but sounded nothing like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc2mqOac6uo">Bob Seger's
"Ramblin Man."</a> <br /><br />I can't remember
how I got free of that but again I was free and I ran to a house that
was a restaurant and I sat at a table. A girl came and sat there though
I knew she felt obligated to be there. I tried my best to be... to be
behaved? I laid a folder on the table, a folder that was actually a
folder fru designed in college that she showed me last night. The girl
opened it and there was a beautifully drawn picture of her. I looked at
the picture; then I looked at her. I loved her, and she knew it. And I
knew that she knew this was what I was giving her. She smiled
gorgeously and said, "I'm gonna go, but I want to keep this." I looked
at her, and I knew she was saying "no, but I'll take what you give
anyway." <br /><br />I looked down at the photo and it started turning colors: the
paper fading to an antiqued yellow and the ink that defined her into a
beautiful dark green. I thought to myself about twittering to <a href="http://staires.org/">@brad</a>
again: "d brad now I understand you, man." Then I realized that this
girl was a woman I met last night ( a client's wife). Then I realized that I wasn't in
the restaurant but I was lying on a floor cushion in my living room.
Then I realized I was awake. Then I realized that bandit song was still
playing in my head. Then I realized I still wanted to twitter.
How do you condense this to 140 characters?&nbsp; <br />
