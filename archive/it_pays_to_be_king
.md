The Economist website has [a brief entry](http://www.economist.com/node/16525240?story_id=16525240&fsrc=rss) that shows this interesting chart: a ratio of what a country's political leader is paid in comparison to the country's GDP per person. Fortunately, it seems Kenya's prime minister Ralia Odinga rejected the pay increase that would have given him 240 times the amount the average person he governs!
