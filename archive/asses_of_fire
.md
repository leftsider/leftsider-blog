If only this could be a funny post, like the <a title="Asses of Fire - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asses_of_Fire">movie-within-a-movie with the same name</a>. Maybe then I could think of something witty to say; instead, my only thought rignt now is <em>don't scratch, don't scratch</em>. 

I don't know what I did or how long I've been doing it, but my butt has started itching progressively for the past few days. Today I did my business only to exit the bathroom feeling like I wiped with fiberglass. A feeling like never before.

I know this post is way in "overshare" territory, but yo--I'm desperate at this point. Help a brother out.
