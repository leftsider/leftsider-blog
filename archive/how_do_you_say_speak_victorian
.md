<blockquote>The watchword of this blog has long been one of Robert D. Kaplan’s “top ten rules”: Speak Victorian, Think Pagan. Policymakers must have the freedom to think of all possibilities and options, unrestricted. But never speak outloud: the public isn’t ready to hear it, your enemies will have access to inner thoughts, and the substances of the debate will get lost in the controversy. Defense Minister Kyuma should continue to think pagan, but always speak Victorian in public.</blockquote>
