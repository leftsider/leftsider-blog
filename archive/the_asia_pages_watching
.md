By the way, am I the only Korean-minded blogger that noted that <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1797044,00.html">S.Korea's anthem got played twice</a>? Apparently someone up in the audio box bungled up and, instead of playing Togo's anthem, played 애국가 again. 

My Korean tutor called me from Korea and laughed, "It was a sign. I knew we were gonna win then!"
