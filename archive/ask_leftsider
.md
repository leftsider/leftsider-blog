Yes, people do ask me for advice!



Dear Leftsider, 
I find myself in an awkward situation. I have a guy friend who is single (Boy), and another friend who is as well (GirlA). GirlA suggested that we plan a blind date between her friend (GirlB), so we planned a group outing. 
As soon as the date was done, Girl A kept contacting me regarding Boy. She's fallen for him, even though she was trying to introduce him to GirlB! She wants me to talk to him for her, but what do I do? I feel bad for GirlB....
--Mixed-up Matchmaker

<blockquote>MM,
The ladies must love you! You're very kind an considerate to even think of someone's situation besides your own; many women would say that is a rare trait in a man. but even though you are thoughtful, this situation is mostly out of your control. The more you involve yourself, the more likely you are to be blamed for ruining something that was meant to be--even if it wasn't.
There are two things that you should do in this situation. First, talk to Boy and see which of the two ladies he prefers. If he likes Girl B, you need to pull out of the picture immediately, it's only going to be a catfight between two women at this point. If he likes Girl A, then you should tell her to pursue him and let them bumble their way to romantic bliss.

Hey Leftsider, 
I met a girl last week who is from Canada. She's hot! We hit it off and I got some contact information. Problem is, I'm leaving for the states in three weeks. Plus side is that she's returning to Canada around the same time. 
Should I pursue her? It'd still be a long-distance relationship, but at least we're on the same continent, right?
--Don Juan de Merican

<blockquote>DJ,
The most important thing in a relationship is communication. If you're going to build a relationship with this person, you'll need to ensure that communication can continue effectively. This means distance is a factor, but it also means that willing participation is key as well. Will she be interested in calling your scraggly butt who she never sees every week? Would you be willing to?
However, this is only important if you are looking to build a relationship. Most people with three weeks left in a location are not looking for a relationship, so communication isn't nearly as important as low lights and the right music. I happen to know who you are and I know your skeezy behind isn't looking for love; it's looking for loins. Pursue, but don't lie to yourself and your partner about long distance liaisons. Keep it real.

Leftsider,

More than anything I want to stand out from my peers, but it seems I was born to be a wallflower. Maybe it's hopeless; can I be an overachiever, or is this just something that's genetic?
--O. Dinary

<blockquote>O,
The one thing that makes people really stand out is when they can be themselves. Recently I read that true freedom is knowing yourself and accepting that. I agree.
Maybe you're not a Trump, a Hilton, or a Beyonc√©; that doesn't mean you can't shine in the areas that you do best. All you need, according to a man who I happen to like, is willpower--and that is one thing that anyone can develop and increase. Find what you're good at and go for it--with all your heart.
Finally, think big. Even if you don't reach the stars, the treetops are a lot higher than where you started. There's a reason they're called overacheivers; they shoot for what's beyond the requirement. Good luck!</blockquote>
