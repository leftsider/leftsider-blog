BODY:
I'll be out "fake camping" (in the woods in a fully-furnished cabin instead of a tent) this weekend so enjoy the pause in information. 

Additionally, I just opened a new account with another host. Depending on when I get back in town on Sunday, you may see a completely new leftsider. Until Then!
