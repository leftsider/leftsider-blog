What is an experience?

It isn't a person, place or thing, nor is it related to time. It cannot be expanded, redone or erased. It can be recalled or forgotten, but even in its absence its effect is substantial. In fact, it is the source of our knowledge, so it is very impressive (in the <a href="http://ninjawords.com/impressive">accurate meaning</a> of the word).

Experiences are our responses and reaction to stimulus. It's what we think of a person, the way we feel about a place and how we associate things. In my opinion our life "time" should be spent focusing on the experiences we create rather than goals we set. We are never sure of what we can achieve, but we can definitely gain from every interaction.

Ideally, we want those interactions to be good. But how do we accomplish that? Is it possible to design an experience for maximum benefit? Can our perspective change our experience? The nature of culture, so varying in our species, would lead us to say yes. So why aren't we making better experiences?

The waiting room. The church service. The menu. Can there be improvement to the daily drivel that facilitates an improved life? I sure hope so. My new work as a consultant will focus directly on this (but more about that later), because I believe that in the same way that my personal relationships are enhanced by an understanding of my friends' experiences, business, religion, and community can also be improved. And I think that allowing these stories to flow will create a new level of information that could be, for the first time ever, truly mutually beneficial.
