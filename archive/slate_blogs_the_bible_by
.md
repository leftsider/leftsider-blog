Sofar this is pretty good. I appreciate the fact that although he's not an observant religious practitioner he's a believer nonetheless, and hasn't sought to prove or disprove anything. He merely wants to find out what the Bible (Torah, specifically) really has to say--for himself.

Quite honestly, I think this is what every self-professed follower of the Bible should do. Although the tongue-in-cheek reflections can be optional for your reading. :P
