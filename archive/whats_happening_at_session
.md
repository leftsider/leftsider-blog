My job has two major functions:

* as assistant communication director of the Adventist world church, I develop the organization's web presence and advise departments, divisions and affiliated entities in areas of branding, usage, experience and best practice.

* as the "web guy" in a department that is 100% Mac (which is 100% not supported by our PC-centric IT department), I become the de facto "computer guy" for any technical issues, at home or even when the team goes on-location.

I've never enough time to do both, and this is especially so right now during our 59th General Conference Session.

## Uh, what's a GC Session?

From the website(one of many under my care):

> The General Conference Session is the forum for electing world church officers and voting changes to the church's Constitution. Delegates also hear reports from each of the 13 administrative regions of the church.

In reality, it's much more than that. You bring a couple hundred workers from my office together with a couple thousand delegates and you can expect that number to double with spouses, children and friends. With that number you then need to provide food, programming, and logistical assistance... which only serves to attract more attendees. **This session we're expecting 60,000 to 80,000 attendees.**

That's right, *80,000 people* from around the world. The city of Atlanta said in a press conference today that they expect $80 million dollars to be injected into their economy from this event, which includes the over 50,000 hotel rooms that have been reserved in the city itself (not counting the outskirts and neighboring towns). It is a massive experience that takes loads of work.

## So what do you do?

My two major functions, of course.

* Identify and request every piece of electronic machinery needed for Communication's needs: In our press box overlooking the Georgia Dome, in our press conference room, and of course, in my development office. Everything; down to phone wires.
* Last thursday I flew down to help the IT department as they set up all this stuff, so that my team could come in and work immediately. They're updating websites, sending press releases, shooting news shows and making podcasts--so the don't want to deal with any hiccups. And if they do hiccup, they call me.
* All of our team's sites (over a dozen) are now run by a single CMS installation, which we're feverishly optimizing while the sites themselves are being improved. My great volunteers have been doing an awesome job making the last pieces fall together--be watching the sites closely because new changes are happening faster and faster!
* Our media generation and distribution has been greatly aided by the use of some new software--Pharos' Mediator4. Telling you all it does would be a total topic unto itself, but the guys at Pharos were kind enough to custom build a demo setup for us to use during the event. This is how all the video/audio were generating will get on the web so fast.
* Our newly christened social media specialist has been firing up twitter and other tools to keep the info about Session releasing at a rapid-fire pace. Just keeping up with her is a task unto its own.
* While our news team has photographers and our media services runs all music on the stage, we often have to grab content on our own for our specific needs. Also for the podcast and other sundry items.

Are you getting the picture? It's a lot of work. So, my great team has been doing all kinds of awesomeness from wifi troubleshooting to image manipulation to css editing to listening to me grumble and moan all day--all with a smile. I love these guys... I need a way to hire them permanently.
