BODY:
Last night, I scanned through a copy of the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1549322,00.html">October 30 issue</a> of Time, which gave stats about America, its population, and what we think and believe. I came to realize that, if the information given was accurate, I have very little interaction with the American world at all. 

The first thing that blew my mind was that America is <a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/20061030/who_we_are/">overwhelmingly white</a>. Now I grew up in rural america--so rural that it wasn't until going away for high school that I met an asian--but I always assumed that there were nearly as many blacks as whites, and a growing hispanic population that was preparing to surpass black is the default minority. But according to the article, whites are 80% of the nation. Amazing. 

It also said that for every 1,000 people only 455 are employed. This was stunning. less than half of the nation's inhabitants work. Now I know that this number includes children, seniors, and students, but it's still a sobering thought. Additionally, the type of major jobs people are working was significantly lower in skill than what I had anticipated.

I guess living near the nation's capital has distorted my expectations. Perhaps Washington, D.C., is a microcosm of the world--not of the United States. Either way, I'm completely floored. If I can't believe these facts about my country, how can I know the answer to questions about it's  longevity and efficiency?

And now that we're thinking, just who are the people who we connect with through social networks? Are they the high end of the scale, rather than the average joe? Are their visions indicative of the masses? Are their views even relevant to the masses? As a humorous aside, this would explain to me the popularity of MySpace.....:P

Just the other day I was thinking about myself (particularly some of the opportunities I've recently been given to be closer to the spotlight) and wondered if I was getting just a little overvalued in my own mind. I, the person still in school, still working jobs that I can just barely tolerate, spouting of things that I think sound visionary--am I just fooling myself into ego-stroking? Now, with this information, I wonder whether what I say even matters anymore. And if it does, just how much further ahead are the leaders of the pack?

I'm starting to feel a bit like a groupie going to your pages and such. At first it was the Korea Pop Podcast show! now this. sigh. as for personal value--only you should decide what you are worth to yourself. The world can decide your value to the world. People can say whatever but only you really know you and what your true intentions are.

I think it is a general mistake for people to value themselves. We are not objective in our self-assesments, so we cannot be fair in valuation. Additionally, as we will never come to ourselves for goods and services, we have a disconnect from the social demand that we are supplying. Our value should be based on what we contribute to our community, now how highly we feel about ourselves.

Just for clarification, this is completely different from self-worth. This is what you can determine. What I'm speaking of in this instance is my validity to the people around me.
