BODY:
Despite how open-minded, laid-back and embracing I may seem, there are many things that I do that border on obsessive-compulsive:<br /><ul><li>I take from ice cream, butter and other containers in a smooth, consistent stroke that leaves an even surface--all the way to the bottom. I never dip or stab.</li><li>I balance the trips I make to my parents so that they are equally visited.<br /></li><li>Finger foods are eaten until I can stop at an even number: leave 4 strips of veggie bacon for fru, 8 cherries, and so on.</li><li>I pack my bag with large books first, then two columns of small books--sorted to achieve a stack closest to square. <br /></li><li>I bought <a href="http://www.10socks.com/">10 pairs of socks</a>, each pair numbered (1-10) so that they always stay together. I've used only 5 pair, to be replaced with the remaining 5 as they wear out/are lost.<br /></li><li>Candy and multicolored items should be left in such a state that all colors have the same amount. If you give me 4 red skittles and 5 of every other color, I will eat until all skittle flavors are at 4.</li></ul>While it shows most prominently in food consumption, it pervades every area of my life. While I'd like to think that it gives me some (sym)pathetic charm like Jack Nicholson in "As Good As It Gets," in truth, I don't really get much but added duty. <br /><br />You see, I don't do it for luck or superstition; I do it for a service to others.<br />

EXTENDED BODY:
I am a one-man army, hell-bent on bringing equality to the world. By taking the excess, I hope to give the next individual an unbiased opportunity to choose what they want--not what's left over, not what's popular. In a sense, I am establishing a line of demarcation between choice and consensus.<br /><br />You'd be surprised how much you do each day that is done by default, never even considering the options. You'd be even more depressed if you realized how many times you did things just because they were easier or more acceptable rather than because they were <i>what you wanted</i>. <br /><br />Often this little campaign I'm on finds me doing things I don't want to do, but it's better to choose to sacrifice than to sacrifice for no reason at all. It's necessary for some crazy individuals like me to be the moderators that make this kind of utopia possible. <br /><br />So if you're obsessive about equality, and compelled to act, you can start small and grow. I'm sure there are items in your refrigerator that are in odd-numbered quantities. :)<br />
