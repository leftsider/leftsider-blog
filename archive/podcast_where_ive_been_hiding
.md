Slow posting is a result of some serious plate cleaning. Do I have anything to show for it? Actually, I do!

Announcing....The Korea Pop Podcast Walter Show!

<a href="../music/kppws0922.mp3">Episode 1</a>: The beginning of an era...the world's introduction to Walter, Bryan declines the ultimate sacrifice, and so much more!
<a href="../music/kppws0929.mp3">Episode 2</a>: More high-powered excellence from the dynamite duo. Fathers, Filesharing, and Fall are all topics as we listen to Walter's choice tracks.
<a href="../music/kppws1006.mp3">Episode 3</a>: 트로트 스패셜!!! If you don't know "Turot," This episode may just change your life forever. Listen Now!

I think I'll give this little activity a website of its own....or at least a special section on Leftsider. Stay tuned for more fantastic updates!
