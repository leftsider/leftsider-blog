<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	One of the reasons that I tried to get back into our old community is because I fell in love with our corner location overlooking the community pool and recreational area. The sound of kids playing, lots of grass and trees; I dug that.<br />
<br />
It was an added bonus that our apartments have two large windows and a balcony that extends to both sides. A bonus which I additionally have fallen in love with.
