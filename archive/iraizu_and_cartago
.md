	The next day we went to another volcano, Iraizu, which also was very cold and lacking lava as seen here. I was floored not so much by the crater itself as I was by the drastic change in the flora of the area. I'm not sure if that is because of the sulfuric content, because of the elevation and temperature, or if it means that I should consider a career in studying plant life, but I was impressed.<br />
<br />
After the volcano we toured through Cartago, Costa Rica's first settlement. We saw the ruins of the first catholic church, the man-made lake and hydroelectric dam that powers much of Cartago and San Jose, and the Basilica. I'm sure we did something else but I forgot.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, we got stuck on the side of the road on the way to the volcano due to our van overheating, and we almost got stranded due to corroded cables unhooking form the van's battery and leaving the van dead. Other than that though, it was a wonderful time.<br />
<br />
The next morning we left for Limon.
