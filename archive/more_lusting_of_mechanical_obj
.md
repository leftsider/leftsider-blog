The New York Times reviews Sony's <a title="The New York Times > Technology > Circuits > State of the Art: Home Video Made to Watch on HDTV" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/10/technology/circuits/10stat.html?th">3-chip, HD camera that costs $3,000</a>. While not the definitive source on rating production gear, I felt the Times gave enough of the tech specs to  answer the initial questions of the budding filmmakers to whom Sony is marketing to while cracking enough bad jokes and explaining enough jargon to demystify the parents of budding film
guys who are asking for three grand.

My biggest interest in this camera is wondering whether it will make the PD150 obsolete--or at least cheaper (since I still want one).
