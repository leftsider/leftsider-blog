<blockquote>Nearly every day you go the green grocer’s – but did you ever take a closer look at the superb designed boxes the groceries are offered in? The fruits and veggies in Japan surely look pretty similar to that of any other country, but its packaging certainly doesn’t! PingMag went shopping and presents you a quick photo scrapbook of the eye-catching cardboard boxes you can discover around town.</blockquote>
