BODY:
Misfortune has brought the churning wheels of Leftsider weblinking to a screeching halt. 

I'm trying to start a local web development environment, so I wiped my iBook clean and reinstalled OS X (a nasty Windows habit). But the backup application that I used didn't save my newsreader preferences.....and didn't export my subscriptions. Why would I export my subcriptions when I'm supposedly backing up the entire hard drive?

So there are no sites in my reader now. I'm taking as an opportunity to try out the <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>; we'll see how that turns out.  In the meantime,  you may be forced to sit through my banter. *shudder*
