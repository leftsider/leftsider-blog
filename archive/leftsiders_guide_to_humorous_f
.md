There are two reasons why I joined Facebook besides the fact that I'll do anything to get away from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/its_leftsider">MySpace</a>. The first is that the two people who I communicated with the most on MySpace, my sister and my cousin, already made the migration. It was a matter of keeping in touch, getting responses in hours instead of days.

The second reason? Funny groups. Because Facebook originally was a college-only site, the networking aspect of the site quickly became  "what crazy notion can we band under?" Today, I'd like to introduce you to a few gems.

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2211678511">UCF squirrels can beat up your school's squirrels</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2208523152">Petition to revoke the independence of the United States of America</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2209948167">I wish my homework was asexual so it would do itself.</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2225987026">1) Cut a hole in the box</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2209982805">Writing Papers Single Spaced First Makes My Double Spaced Result Climactic</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2215183344">If being a music major were easy, we'd call it Your Mom.</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204989073">I See That You are Gangster. I am Pretty Gangster Myself.</a> 

There are quite a few others, but being sophomoric humor (literally) many are not fit for public announcement. Feel free to peruse and find the group that tickles your fancy!
