It's all over now, but there are many questions that remain:

* **Road Protocol:** What is the method for choosing which roads get attention first?
* **Pedestrian Value:** Obviously the suburbs don't care for pedestrian travel, but in the tighter, urban, walkable areas... what happens to sidewalks, paths and trails in a snowstorm? It would seem the sidewalks connected to condominiums were the only ones that were maintained in Bethesda (outside of the shopping district).
* **Schnowdenfreude:** Is there any level of pleasure/sadness gained by snow removal personnel from their job? What about when their work assists/undoes the work of others? What about instances when [someone's inactivity prevents them from a complete job](http://yfrog.com/4fdp4nj)?
* **Where does it go?** Last night a dozen dump trucks were loaded with removed snow... where does all that white stuff go?
* **Moving Glaciers:** What is the mindset of the person who cleans their car off completely? The person who leaves a huge mound of snow on their roof?

Even in the most mundane things, we can discover so much about a culture, a person, a way of thinking. So before you think this post completely useless: what question above would not be useful to improving user experience--not just in product design but specifically in website/interface improvement and application development?

Going downtown tonight it seems sidewalks got much better treatment. Perhaps Bethesda is not as committed to walkability as they've presented ([walkscore.com](http://www.walkscore.com) gives us a 92 out of 100).

Another comment: Apparently [a cop drew a gun](http://bit.ly/8w4aDU) on a huge snowball fight that took over 14th and U this weekend. What was the psychology behind *that* snow management?
