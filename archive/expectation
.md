BODY:
A few years ago, I was sitting on a low stool in my (possibly favorite) apartment when Fru called from the kitchen, "Would you like some cereal?"

"Yes," I replied.

"You want Chex?"

"Sure."

"Do you want me to add raisins?" **And it was with this question that I attained enlightenment.**

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

Time stopped, and I wondered about what I should say. If she had given me a bowl of cereal--with raisins or without--I would have been happy. But because she asked my selection would now establish expectations. 

If I said "no thank you" but she brought my bowl with raisins added I'd be disappointed--even though a bowl with raisins would have been perfectly acceptable if she had never asked. The converse would yield the same result. In fact I had asked for raisins and she complied, the *amount* of raisins in my cereal could fall short of my expectations and leave me disappointed. 

Thus I came to a conclusion:

I'm not saying don't have standards. I'm not saying you're stupid to have goals. I'm saying be careful the expectations you make because every expectation is an opportunity for disappointment. I'm not the first to discover this [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha).

When I had that realization, I worked for a long time to remove expectation (in the form of preference [*](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2008/03/the-end-of-preference.html) ) from my life. I was unsuccessful. Only recently have I deliberately allowed myself to strive or to yearn for things, and the first feeling that wells up is fear--the fear of disappointment and failure.

Therefore I do not feel that my realization is false. Rather, I accept it as a truth which I cannot currently attain. Man is no more able to remove expectation and preference from his life than he is to remove disappointment and dissatisfaction. Accepting this reinforces my assertion.

Or as I always like to say: "The secret to happiness is low expectations."

Which, like you said, doesn't mean have no standards. Expect the worst and work for the best.
