BODY:
Part of turning 40 (!!) was coming to terms with my relevance in society. It's still a work in progress. 

I live in a young people city and I work in an industry with a youth fetish, so there's this constant immersion in twenty-somethings that makes it hard to live like my twenties ended a decade ago. What do 40-something people do besides raise children, chase youth, and hate life? I don't have an interest in any of those things, and I don't know many people who are at this stage of life who are doing something other than that. 

So I've started making a list of things that I can do, in relative obscurity, for the next half of my life. 

* **Build and maintain flexibility and mobility.** I've always enjoyed athletics and physical activity, but my feelings of not being a great sportsman and my (probably related) lack of competitive spirit usually relegated me to sporadic, non-organized exercise. I tried the gym, but I've always felt my gym activity generates personal narcissism. That said, I've been discovering people who are in [great shape](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt_9VoWBKeR/?igshid=h0x4wp7ikg91) who are doing [great things](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz-6LhlHZ5l/?igshid=4593uoqar9mi) that are [not about competition or vanity](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLISqbIigp/?igshid=3nwrhar9vxib). And that looks like something I could do for a while without too much preening or acting like I'm not a bald fart.
* **Code.** I really miss the good old days of this site, when it was as much about building as it was about writing. Learning HTML and CSS was such a big thing for me back then, and gave me so much opportunity. It's sad that I do absolutely zero of that now. Moreover, I'm increasingly drawn back to my roots by the magnetic waves of the [indieweb movement](https://indieweb.org/). The web was made for building your own thing and representing yourself to the world--not for sharing your insignificant opinion on absolutely everything that happens in an ecosystem designed to [extract your data for profit's sake](https://medium.com/@leftsider/the-tangled-graph-we-weave-581f842279ff). Why not build my own thing and expand myself in the process? Also, despite all of that anarchist anti-conglomerate speak I'd still love to work at Google before it's all done and they tend to only hire people with real coding chops. 
* **Read and write.** Once upon a time this used to be "learn languages." But as much as I still love learning languages I realize that a big part of what pushed me to learn languages was to meet and impress new people. As an old, looking to engage with other olds, there are fewer people looking to find a novel foreigner who is speaking their language once you hit this age. I think if I maintain my abilities through reading and writing it will allow me to enjoy the efforts of my younger years for a long time. There's also general reading and writing on this blog to be done as well. 
* **Learn about myself.** Look, no one really cares what I do now that I'm 40. This is why the olds stop trying to know the latest songs, memes and fashion trends. You get almost no value from being in the know, because you're still an old. So why not take that precious effort and direct it somewhere that matters? [My somatica training](http://leftsider.com/cgi-bin/mtos5/mt-search.cgi?search=somatica&IncludeBlogs=3&limit=20) started at 40, and it's changed so much of how I see the world. Why stop there? I'll still be old and irrelevant, but at least I'll be happy and growing as I become a living fossil. 

In all seriousness, it's really important to make LIVING something you do until you're dead. I intend to do that.
