	Bitterly cold today. A high of -4 Celsius??? Had to cut our day tour of 경주(gyeong-ju) short; nobody wants to be out in that kind of weather. All you people in weather that's much colder.....I don't want to hear how mild that is. I hate cold almost as much as <a href="http://www.thisiswhatwedonow.com/2006/01/global-warming-keep-it-coming.html">this guy</a>.<br />
<br />
BTW this is not my picture, and it is not Korea. This is in Japan.
