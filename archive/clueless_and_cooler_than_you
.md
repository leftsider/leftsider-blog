Today my friend Minjung (이민정) showed me her new phone.

The top of this LG phone has a huge screen, while the bottm has a scrunched keypad. On the back of the keypad is a <em>5.0 megapixel camera</em>. My stupid camera--an actual camera--has only 2.0. The bottom portion also spins so that you can see yourself on the big huge screen while you take your picture with the <em>5.0 megapixel camera</em>. 

Minjung currently doesn't know how to answer the phone, so you can be sure this isn't some technophile with the newest gadget. No, this is just life in Korea. When I get the model off her I'll update with pics.
