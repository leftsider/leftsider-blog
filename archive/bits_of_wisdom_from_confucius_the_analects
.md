BODY:
* "If a man sets his heart on benevolence, he will be free from evil."
* "In his errors, a man is true to type. Observe the errors and you will know the man."
* "In his dealings with the world, the gentleman is not invariably for or against anything. He is on the side of what is moral."
* "When you meet someone better than yourself, turn your thoughts to becoming his equal. When you meet someone not as good as you are, look within and examine your own self."
* "It is rare for a man to miss the mark through holding on to essentials."

I think more people should stop making Confucius Jokes and start actually reading Confucius.
