Who isn't fascinated by Chinese characters? A single graphic that encapsulates an entire word, concept or idea; it brushes upon essence of linguistic efficiency--deterred only by the fact that there are so many words, concepts and ideas to be represented.<br /><br />Some manifest their fascination by a permanent inking (which I <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/chinese-tattoo/">do not advise</a>). Others follow the stroke and order to inspiration through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_calligraphy">calligraphy</a>. For me it is enough to simply use them; being able to communicate with an audience so vast is awe-inspiring. With the assistance of modern technology I can use the learning of a language to speak with the world. <br /><br />So in addition to my mother's tongue, Spanish, my first truly foreign language, Korean, and my dabblings in Japanese, I've started taking a class in Chinese. We've received Chinese names this week, and I asked my professor If I could use the same Chinese characters I used when making my Korean name (In Korean, Chinese characters are called "hanja"). <br /><br />My Korean name is 이강진, Kang-jin Lee. To show her my name, I looked up my name again in my <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=psO_Oli22m8C&amp;dq=handbook+of+korean+vocabulary&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=YKfbxLesS3&amp;sig=RMRPx6NBKIFc_WaZXn3qHKTJZqs&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=handbook+of+korean+vocabulary&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail">Korean vocab book</a>. I found the characters easily, but I didn't know how to write Chinese on my mac. Once I did, I realized I didn't know the Chinese pronunciation of these characters, so I still couldn't type them. What I needed was was a <a href="http://kldp.net/projects/hanja/">Hangul(Korean) to Hanja conversion</a>--or a way to select hanja while typing Korean. After a little searching, turns out <a href="http://www.foolsworkshop.com/120a/koreanmac.html#hanja">you can already do that on a Mac</a>. Who knew?<br /><br />So now I can type to you using Chinese, Korean and two of Japanese's three character systems (the third basically being Chinese)--in addition to the alphabetical systems. Hopefully someone will find this article an easy reference for typing in Chinese on their Mac. Oh, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Entering_toned_pinyin_with_Mac_OS_X">how to type in Pinyin on a Mac</a> as well.<br />
