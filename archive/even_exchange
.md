So last night I met with Walter(how do Koreans pick English names?) and went over our plan. He is a member of our church's youth group, a starcraft player, and a gadgets guy with a serious need to improve english. I am and English speaking, games-needing, k-pop fiending former volunteer english teacher with lots of free time. Bing! A friendship has been created.

It's really cool because this will give me an opportunity to keep those skills sharp as well as an "in" into the games and media I've been going on and on about. Plus I like this guy's laidback style and humor, and wouldn't mind helping a fellow geek out. 

We're set to meet twice a week in addition to his daily personal study time. He seems like he'll be a good student so I have nothing but high hopes for the whole thing. Wish us luck!
