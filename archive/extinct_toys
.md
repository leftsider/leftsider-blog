BODY:
These are very well-designed, handcrafted wooden toys by Josh Finkle. **They are very cute, but there's one problem:** they are caricatures of recently extinct animals.  

Here's the [link](http://jfinkle.com/extincttoys.php)

There are obvious reasons that I think he explains rather well as to why these are chosen. I can't help but wonder though, about their end result--will they lead me to a higher awareness to the fragility of nature... or will I eagerly await the next set of dead species turned in to cute lovable playthings?
