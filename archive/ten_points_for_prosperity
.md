[<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Number_of_High_Net_Worth_Individuals%2C_2011_v4.jpg/282px-Number_of_High_Net_Worth_Individuals%2C_2011_v4.jpg" align="right">](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth)The power, influence and resources necessary to improve the world--and your world--is [held by a few rich, powerful and influential people](http://www.wider.unu.edu/events/past-events/2006-events/en_GB/05-12-2006/). 
1. These [people](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/10/10/3578399/survey-finds-white-men-have-eight-times-as-much-political-power-as-women-of-color/), [overwhelmingly](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/uk-map-white-male-power-4649671), are [male](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/). They also happen to be [mostly white](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/why-are-there-so-few-black-investors/#H3D8wI:7xQt).
1. When they [extend their influence](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/30/the-one-percent-is-way-more-politically-active-than-you-are/) and share their resources, they do so to those who are most familar (and similar) to them.
1. Whether these people are racist or not, this practice qualifies as [institutional racism](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/143049/fredrick-c-harris-and-robert-c-lieberman/racial-inequality-after-racism).
1. Fun fact: despite much "knowledge" to the contrary, there is no scientific evidence of any human difference based on skin color or hair texture. [There is only one race; the human race.](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/143050/kwame-anthony-appiah/race-in-the-modern-world)
1. Most of what is considered to be race-specific is actually culturally or environmentally acquired. These behaviors can be learned.
1. Knowing these facts, many have improved their situation by studying and adopting the language, behavior and practices of a better-situation. Some do so on-demand, retaining their first culture. This is referred to as "[code-switching](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/04/13/177126294/five-reasons-why-people-code-switch)."
1. Code-switching reinforces the inappropriate advantage of the power-holder. Adopting their behavior restricts prosperity in diversity.
1. **True, scalable and diverse prosperity is most successfully achieved by the collective commitment of disparate communities to elevate prosperity through their own means, free of assistance and in a way that works specifically for them.** [Oppression cannot be ended by the oppressor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppressors%E2%80%93oppressed_distinction); it must be ameliorated by the oppressed--preferably in love, which breaks the cycle of hatred.
1. Looking at the lessons from the experiences of others, including those currently holding power, one must *work* to develop prosperity for self and for those like self. I am the catalyst for change in the world--in my world.
