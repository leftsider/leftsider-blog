BODY:
Who says you need to be original to make something great? 

The new design is almost 100% unoriginal. Backround image stolen from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shelbob/">Janesdead</a>, to mimic <a href="http://www.maniacalrage.com/">Maniacalrage</a>. Content and css culled in tribute to <a href="http://www.emilychang.com/">Emily Chang</a>. And I'm happy with it. Any usability issues? Comments? Questions? Criticisms? Let me know.
