One of the benefits of shedding most of what you own and moving across the country is the opportunity to be deliberate about the new lifestyle you want to establish as you settle in. Whether you'd like to change your life completely, reorient yourself to an established intention, or reinforce a current course [°](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2011/01/expectation.html), relocation provides a clean canvas to illustrate your ideals.

Having read Vatsayana's depiction of the ideal life of a citizen in the *Kama Sutra* [°](http://www.bharatadesam.com/literature/vatsyayana_kamasutras/vatsyayana_kamasutra_4.php), I was really excited to find our new residence blocks from the bay, relatively quiet yet convenient to the city, and even providing a small backyard with aromatic and fruit-bearing palntings. He'd certainly be pleased.

Still, his recommendation for daily living has a scent of conspicuous consumption about it. I'm not sure of my immunity against Affluenza [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluenza) so modification is necessary. I've always been interested in simple living [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living). 

Reading on Epicureanism [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism) , I find that:

> In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship, and living a virtuous and temperate life. He lauded the simple life, and advocated reducing one's desires [...]

This highest pleasure is known as *Ataraxia* [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia). How can we use technology to promote and disperse ataraxia--tranquility and freedom from fear? I'll be thinking about this as I develop the tone of my new life here in San Francisco.
