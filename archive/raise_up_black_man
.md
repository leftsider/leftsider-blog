I been reading this gut a lot, and I have to say when he's good, he's darn good. From the profile picture he looks like this guy I went to elementary school with name Lamont Johnson. But there's no way that guy got that smart. He's probably still in Delaware somewhere, in dire need of this article. And so for you, Lamont--and everyone else who hasn't assimilated yet--I make this post.
