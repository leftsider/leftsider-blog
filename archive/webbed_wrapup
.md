I've decided to approach my web findings a little differently. 

In my world, I drop interesting links into my bookmark folder to be reviewed and sorted at a later date(usually Mondays and Fridays). Then, I periodically go through and read, sort and/or drop them. Tangentally, I've got a bookmarks folder that you wouldn't believe. Not in the least bit cluttered, either.

In Leftsider, as a direct result of this new schedule, I'll probably post most web findings in groups rather than individual entries. The only exception is if there's something exceptional(duh) or if I'd like to comment/wax philosophical.

Well it's Monday, so here goes:


<a title="BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | Released Palestinians return home" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4282925.stm">BBC NEWS: Released Palestinians return home</a>
Quite possibly the most boring headline I've read this year. Luckily I heard the news elsewhere; there's no way that title would have piqued my interest enough to merit a click.
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6998205/?GT1=6190">Baby stable after second head removed</a>
Now here's the exact opposite; I couldn't click fast enough. I'm having a moral crises right now whether to feel sad for the other head; it had no body, lungs, stomach....but was "...capable of smiling and blinking..."OMG!!!
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66642,00.html">Wired News: Office Sweeties Have No Secrets</a>
Tell me something I don't know. I know people on both sides of that story, so it's not an exception, people; it's a fact. Save it for home...
<a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/danger/paris-hiltons-sidekick-ii-hacked-what-about-yours-033637.php">Gizmodo: Paris Hilton's Sidekick II Hacked</a> (AGAIN)
I have a soft spot for this girl. She's enviously rich, spoiled rotten, and seemingly clueless to everyday reality. Yet I find something about her sweet, kind and charming. Plus I totally stole my current word "hot" from her a la <em>Simple Life Season 1</em>. Still, fool me twice....? All said, her mobile pics gallery is 35x better than anyone else's I've seen...<strong>NSFW BOOBIES!!!</strong>

Got any info? let a brother know.
