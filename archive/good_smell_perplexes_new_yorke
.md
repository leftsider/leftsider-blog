You have no idea how comically insane this article is. I dont even; I'm still finding new ways to scoff at this absurdity. Cross referenced with a <a href="http://www.andreaharner.com/archives/2005/10/help_im_stuck_in_a_maple_syrup_b.html">Andrea Harner post</a> (whose website seems awfully designed--remember when it was cute?)
