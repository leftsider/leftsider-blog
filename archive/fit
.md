As the new year came around, I decided to do something about it. I started a facebook event under my B.A.S.T.I.O.N. group called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224622212983">B.A.S.T.I.O.N F.I.T.</a> (Fitness in 2010).<p></p>

<p>The problem with getting more active is that it really works best when you're doing it with others. Coincidentally, no one wants to commit to something like that. Still, the peer support can do wonders, so with this event you can choose your own goals and method (or select from one of the methods listed) and just use the event as a means of support. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, over 20 people immediately signed up. It seems I'm the only one posting regularly, but it was nice to see others with a similar interest.</p>

<p>I'm working up my stamina, so I'm starting with running and hoping to be at a level where I can do <a href="http://texafornia.squarespace.com/home/2009/2/13/the-push-running-secret-revealed-p90x-prep-done-easy.html">ZenTri's P90x prep</a> pretty regularly. It's a little bit harder than I expected. I'm way out of shape. Started feeling awkwardness in my legs, so I <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/7490907021">asked a twitter friend</a> who happens to be a triathlete. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Likely connective tissue tears--where tendon meets bone. If [you] haven't been running, connective tissue [becomes] weak. Muscle pulls away from bone. Light leg circuit weight training at gym (12-15 reps) will strengthen ligament/bone connection."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it looks like I'll possibly be doing more than just running to get fit. Looking forward to the energy boost <a href="http://twitter.com/ZenTriathlon">@ZenTriathlon</a> promises--and looking forward to being fit and firm when the weather gets warm!</p>
