BODY:
Fru and I are reading the Bible, a chapter at a time, in our evening 
worship. We recently finished the four-chapter book of Ruth, and my 
first reaction was:

> "Why isn't this called the book of Boaz?"

For those of you unfamiliar with the story--a brief recap: God promised 
Abraham that a great nation would come from his line. His grandson, Jacob, 
had twelve sons and changed his name to Israel. After 400 years of 
servitude to the Egyptians, the cries of the children of Israel were heard 
by God, who remembered his promise to Abraham. Freeing them from bondage 
through Moses, they set off for the land he promised to Jacob. 
Rehabilitating them along the way, the land the finally reached was divided by the twelve 
tribes of Israel--each tribe coincidentally named after Israel's twelve sons. 
The people were generally grateful to God but his presence struggled 
to be more than a part of their history; they often found themselves 
adopting the belief systems and deities of the surrounding nations. 

Still with me?

So one guy moved away from the Israelite states into an area called 
Moab. He and his wife settled there and had two sons, who married 
Moabite women. Unfortunately the man and his sons died--leaving 
three widows. The mother-in-law, Naomi, urged her daughters to go back 
to their people, hoping they might still be able to remarry. One 
reluctantly agreed, but the other, Ruth, insisted on staying. She went 
with Naomi, who returned to the land of her people and where she might 
have better fortune. 

In those days, there were a lot of rules to ensure people were cared 
for. Land owners, for example, were charged not to make a second pass 
in their harvesting, but to leave the missed grain behind for the widow 
or the orphan. Also, if a man died without a male descendant there would be 
no one to inherit his share of the tribal possessions. For this reason, 
a son-less widow was to be remarried to a kin to her husband, who was 
responsible for her. This kinsman not only took in the widow but also 
was to have kids with her, redeeming that family's line.

Ruth asked her Moabite daughter-in-law to go after the harvesters and 
collect grain for their provisions. The field she happened to choose 
belonged to Boaz, a kinsman of her late father-in-law. He regarded her 
with kindness, wishing the Lord's wings of protection to cover Ruth, her
mother-in-law, and even asking his harvesters to leave a little extra for 
her to pick after them. Naomi naturally went into matchmaker mode and 
hoping that Ruth might catch more than just his favor! 

When the harvest was done, usually the landowner and his harvest men
slept on the threshing floor with the grain to protect against theft.
It subsequently became a time of male camaraderie and revelry, my 
study Bible says. Naomi convinced Ruth to dress up practically like a 
bride and sneak onto the threshing floor after Boaz had had his fill 
of wine and had fallen to sleep away from his men. She instructed her
to uncover his feet and to sleep next to them. Naturally, when the wine
wore down and he felt his blanket not on his feet, he looks down to see
Ruth sleeping there. He asks her why she is there, and she (perfectly)
expresses her wish to be cared for by him, asking him to extend the 
corner of his blanket to cover her (a tongue-in-cheek reference to his
exact wish that God would protect her with his wings). Boaz, semi-drunk 
and totally impressed by the bold yet noble behavior of Ruth, promises
to sort out the situation the next day. He give her some more grain and 
sends her on her way before anyone would discover her there.

The situation, it turns out, was that he was second in the line of
kinsman who could redeem Naomi's family. In the morning he found the 
kinsman ahead of him and, in the presence of the elders, made him aware
of Naomi and Ruth's need. The kinsman recognized Boaz's report and gave
intent to do this kinsman-redeemer duty. Boaz slyly implied, however that there was a 
lot of responsibility, particularly in the way of producing an heir 
(it seems perhaps this kinsman may have already been married?). Citing
risk to his existing estate, he demurred, and suggested perhaps Boaz could
take the responsibility in his stead, to which Boaz humbly agreed.

The day was saved, Ruth and Boaz were married, Ruth had a son named Obed,
who carried on the family line, having his own son named Jesse, who just 
so happens to be the father of David of the "David and Goliath" story 
(and whose line goes all the way to the earthly parents of Jesus). 

A lot of people like this story; it's like the Bible's own medieval fairy
tale. I've always heard it told with such emphasis on the romance between
Ruth and Boaz, but to be honest I didn't see romance at all when reading it
directly. What I saw basically consisted of two destitute women using the 
only things they had--their brains and their charm--to survive, and a man 
who went out of his way to redeem two hopeless-yet-sincere people with 
exceptional character. Actually, if there was any person in the story whose 
character was to be imitated, I'd say it was Boaz--hence my original 
question: Why is this book named after Ruth and not after him?

I'd love to be a kinsman redeemer; I'd love it more if everyone tried to be 
one in their own way. Restoring peace and safety in the lives of those 
in misfortune, lending power and support to the disadvantaged, making it 
our responsibility to see the lives of others continue comfortably. In fact, 
Boaz went above and beyond the call of duty by taking responsibility for a 
situation that he was under no obligation to fix; remember there was 
another who was actually the person to take responsibility. It's a 
very god-like benevolence, and I can't help but think of the Christ 
himself teaching, preaching, healing and helping. In fact, Jesus *is* the 
*ultimate* kinsman redeemer. He is not a chip off of Boaz's block; Boaz, 
rather, is a glimpse at what our Redeemer is really like.

> If Jesus is our Boaz, then Ruth is us.

The book may be named after Ruth because she represents us, reflects us. 
We can find ourselves in dire situations with totally busted plans. We 
may even be a foreigner to the concept of a kinsman redeemer, just following 
the instructions of someone who does. But if our heart is sincere and our 
purpose is true, He will count our faithfulness as righteousness and 
reinstate us through his unmerited favor towards us. 

The book of Ruth is about someone like us; it's my book. 
I think that's kind of cool.
