Another TED video (they're great!). Although this is a really old one that I've seen before (and was reminded of when I saw Jeff in <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4217348.html">this video</a> about Microsoft's "Milan" project) the thing I want to note about his presentation is that about halfway in he says that he cringes when he thinks about the $100 computer being sent out developing countries because in this day and age <strong>no one should ever have to conform to hardware in order to communicate</strong>.

Indeed, my latest fascination is with understanding <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/05/now_that_the_semester_is.htm">how we can make technology culturally transparent
</a> so these kind of things really make me feel like a kid in a candy store. Can you imagine how life will be when that Milan table costs $500 instead of $5000? With the operating system built for multiple input, would one $500 Milan table be worth more than five $100 computers (which are hopefully much more advanced than the current version)?

Will we still need <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/06/elasticity_plasticity.htm">plasticity</a> when we create a communicative medium that interprets our input in a way that is native to us and outputs it in a way that is familiar to the recipient? Just a thought. :)

It's also interesting that when i first saw his presentation, that comment passed by without even a blip on my radar.
