BODY:
Every so often I get inspired to really get down and do something spectacular. Generally, these inspirations are squashed by lunchtime. 

Today was no different. Holiday; I'm thinking chill at home and get some stuff done. In fact, I was so excited by the concept that I woke up at 6:30 and got straight to work. My goals? To start working on a Leftsider redesign, and to start rearranging the furniture around the apartment (something we do periodically in a quest for feng shui zen perfection).

Hopped on the computer, noted a conversation about the CMS system <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>. Hey, why don't I install that locally and try it out? Sounds like a good idea. Except I haven't set up my <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/">development environment on the MacBook</a>... need to install MySQL, PHP, update Apache and Perl.

But wait... isn't there something for OS X that does this all in one install? Was it <a href="http://locomotive.raaum.org/">Locomotive</a>? no, that's for Ruby on Rails. Aha! It was <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/home.php">MAMP</a>! Let's install it and we'll be on our way.

Well MAMP installs no problems, but EE isn't sensing the setup. Tweak here; nothing. Move this to there; nope. Remove and reinstall EE; nada. This is the part of the story where my bleary eyes can bore holes through lead. I become super-analytical and, unfortunately for my wife, start obsessing over minute details both on and off the screen.

The fam calls and reminds me that today is my grandfather's birthday. So I walk away from the problem and head over to Delaware to spend the afternoon with him and others celebrating. Good times. Head back as the sun sets and the whole country seems to be shooting off fireworks.

Get back, sit down, go back at the problem--but to no avail. The number of accessible, Mac-familiar webdev folks in my social circles is pretty slim, so I have yet to even get to the site redesign stuff.

While the trip back home was great, it did waste the time I had for rearranging my pad. So now I've got 0 to show for my day. Sometimes I wonder why we even try.
<strong>
UPDATE:</strong> 20 minutes this morning on my old iBook (which I manually installed MySQL and PHP rather than going the contained dev environment route) and EE is working. I must be doing something wrong with MAMP.

Have you tried the forums at EE?

I haven't. I've been looking for info on MAMP, since that's the thing I've never done before. Maybe I should, though.
