BODY:
About two months ago I sold my DJ equipment. But apparently, two months isn't enough for closure.

EXTENDED BODY:
I put them up on Ebay. I hadn't used Ebay previously so I was pretty pensive about the whole thing. I was super-clear in all my descriptions, very literal in the shipping process and a really cool guy won the auction for a VERY nice price.

The first problem was that the guy was from Canada. Unbeknownst to me, Paypal can't easily verify Canadian checks, so the money took 15 days to be cleared. That was December 30, and I was already in Korea. I had talked to Joey and he said he'd send them for me when he got back from Georgia, also on the 30th.

Joey died on the 2nd. His parents came up and cleared out all his stuff, my dad picked up what they had salvaged of mine, and my neighbor held the gear until someone could get it for me.

First friend was willing but we played phone tag and then he was away for a week on business. Second friend wanted to help but had a phobia of being near places where people died. Missed connections, no pickup. Third dude owed me a favor, so I called it in. He said sure, but didn't get them. I reminded him, and he promised in a few days. Then he got them, but didn't send them.

We're well into January at this point. The buyer has been extremely nice and is patiently waiting, however, Paypal's 45-day (yes that long) claim deadline was looming and he didn't want to be screwed out of his cash. He sent me an apologetic letter on the day he filed the claim and said if the stuff got sent he'd withdraw it.

I'm now calling to the states rather than relying upon email. Get a hold of sender #3, who informs me that the cheapest price that he can find is three times the quote I received from UPS. Also, the tables are at a friend's warehouse so that they can be shipped the next day. A few hours later he gives me a confirmation code, which I pass on to the buyer.

Then silence. No word from anyone if anything has been received. Paypal claim is still active, I have no equipment, I've paid extra for shipping, and if it continues in this vein, I'll lose the money in paypal that purchased the gear. So essentially I've given my stuff for free and paid someone to ship it.

Finally, this is one of the last two things that is a constant reminder of losing Joey. The other thing is mail, which still needs to be sorted out. I'm hoping to be done with it all so that I can move on. It's taking life energy from me constantly worrying about these things.
