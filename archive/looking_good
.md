<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/IMG_3011.jpeg"><img alt="IMG_3011.jpeg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/10/IMG_3011-thumb-400x266-73.jpeg" width="400" height="266" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>This is a picture of yours truly, taken during a trip to NYC this summer. Despite the very nice composition by [@imnotmok](http://www.twitter.com/imnotmok), All I see when looking at this pic is *bad form*. Haggard eyes, poor posture--and that awful gut.

I know I'm getting old. I'm never going to look as good as I did when I was young (and even less than I thought I looked). But even in aging, one hopes they can grow gracefully rather than ungraciously.

The problem is finding the reason for looking good.

When I look at this photo, what is offended is my pride and self-esteem. I do not see a guy particularly unhealthy or at risk of any sort. I do not feel this person is closer to death than they might assume. I feel, quite frankly, unsexy.

But why do I need to feel sexy? I am past my prime, happily married to a woman who has probably always been a much better looker than yours truly. I'm a lucky man; not a man trying to get lucky. And it would seem that my only concern is that other people find me as attractive as possible.

The fact that this pic makes me want to immediately engage in crunches and pull-ups is so that the young (and not-so-young) pretty females (and let's be honest; even a little from teh gays) of the city will consider me one of their own, who has gone boldly and attractively into the next phase of life. That vision is about as superficial and philosophically vapid as I can imagine. 

So do I turn away and become a virtuous Quasimoto or embrace and become the [Dilf](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=D.I.L.F.) of my vain dreams? Is there some other reason why a reasonably healthy, non-competitive man would want to take on the added cost of moving from average to chiseled?

Why do you assume the reason you look at yourself and want to improve is simply because of the stereotypical "I want the bitches to drool"? Sure, it's instinctual to peacock to attract ladies, but like you said, you're married---and besides, old man, you couldn't keep up with them young ladies quite like a youthful, virile, dapper gent like myself could---so that's not conscious. I doubt it's even subconscious.

Let's think about that time period when people painted pictures of fat girls, ya know, the really pale ones with big round bellies and they're usually just laying on ornate furniture, and there's food somewhere around them so you know all they're doing is lying around getting fatter... You're educated, so it's not like I need to explain this to you, but hey: it's because back then, in order to be fat, you had to be wealthy or you had to have a lot of free time. Being pale, similarly, meant that you weren't some dumb prole stuck out in the fields laboring or building shit. You had time to just sit in doors, out of the sun, 'cause you were wealthy. Being with a pale fat girl meant that you had money, that you had class. It cost both those things to feed a woman til she was bloated back then. If they had McDonald's back then everyone would be with a fat girl.

Now-a-days, of course, being fat means you're probably poor. It also means you're probably stupid, because you don't care about yourself. Lying around, surrounded by food? That's not a statement of class anymore, that's a statement of being a poor, lazy slob. Now if you're tan it doesn't mean "you were out laboring like a prole", it means "you're wealthy enough to have enough free time to concentrate on your tan".

So when you look at yourself, maybe you're thinking this: Damn, I'm not very good at playing my part. I'm a smart, well-educated, and financially well-off man, and look at the dude in that picture: he's slouching, like he's got no confidence. He's got a gut, like he doesn't care about his appearance at all or doesn't have the time to... Dang, I'm even a bit pasty for a black guy, I guess this monitor tan ain't working for me...

In short you're failing to demonstrate your class, which wounds your pride. It might have nothing to do with attracting females, but simply that by failing to impress others, you're failing to impress yourself.

We do not hold ourselves to standards simply because we think others do. We hold ourselves to standards because we hold other people to those same standards. When we don't measure up to our own standards but still hold other people to them (that's really what you're doing here, you're looking at yourself objectively as if you don't know it's you and you're judging yourself) it causes some cognitive dissonance and makes us question everything.

Ouch!

Really like this writing, Stuy. Sorry it got hung up in my spam comments. It's good enough, however, that I'm responding even now.

Your point is well written, and to be honest I've never even thought of it that way. To say that I'm certain your suggestion is not the case would be a dismissal without actual evaluation. Generally (and increasingly) I'm very anti-class [*](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/06/unlocked-increasingly-tethered.html), but I'm willing to give it some thought and come back to it later.
