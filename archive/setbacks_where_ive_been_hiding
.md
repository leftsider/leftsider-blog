Because Daegu has been good to me, I decided to return the favor. If you've ever looked up information on Daegu (which I'm sure you haven't) you'd have run across <a title="The Daegu Guide - A Multimedia Guide to Life in Daegu Korea" href="http://thedaeguguide.com/">The Daegu Guide</a>--a once-useful now-outdated website with tons of information of varying current value.

I felt bad about the state of the site since so many people cross it's threshold, so I dropped an email asking how I could help. A few online conversations later, I held the keys to the site, given to me by the site's host, manager of KoreaBridge.

At first I worked feverishly on a unique and fashionable design, but then I started reading some web design workflow books and decided to take a different approach. Rather than making a Daegu Guide 2.0, why not start with a version 1.1? There's enough to divide into a few different upgrades, and then I don't need to worry about alienating the faithful few who are still checking the site with any reguarity.

First on the list (even before the purple background) was the frames. Oh good heavens lets be done with that. Combining the pages into one allowed for the use of layers, which naturally lends itself to CSS styling. I created a site that looked strikingly similar, yet was a big step towards my grand design.

I actually was hoping to share the test area with a few people last week, but disaster struck. Due to some iBook issues that cropped up while I was file transferring with Dreamweaver, I managed to erase the index page both on the server and on my machine. Back to square one.

Almost. Since I did everything in CSS, the structure is still there....I just gotta pull the content out of my butt again.

So....maybe in a week or two you'll be seeing a positive update to this post. Yet another project seeing progress. I don't feel like I'm going fast enough, but I'd rather be consistent that quick.
