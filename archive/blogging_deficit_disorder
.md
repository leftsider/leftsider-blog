<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last weekend, driving through Georgia and South Carolina, I saw people sitting on their porches--no smartphone, no ipad--watching cars pass.</p>&mdash; leftsider (@Leftsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/604790882240364544">May 30, 2015</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I grew up spending summer evenings on our back porch, watching the birds roost and the sun set. It&#39;s hard for me to even imagine now.</p>&mdash; leftsider (@Leftsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/604791406696108033">May 30, 2015</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maybe living in cities prevents me from practicing the habits of observing from afar. Maybe technology prefers my short-range consumption.</p>&mdash; leftsider (@Leftsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/604793155557285888">May 30, 2015</a></blockquote>

One thing is certainly true; the length of time between posts to Leftsider has little to do with available time. It has much more to do with an aversion to anything in the long form: reading, writing, and even watching--whether live or cinematic.

It's as if my brain has now been hand crafted for the 140-character Tweet, the persistent notification and the instant gratification. Unlike those southern residents who were seemingly content to exist without objective, Even that with a plot falls if it doesn't catch me quickly. 

I worry about this. I worry about what I'm sacrificing in order to flourish in the moment. I wonder if there are [larger effects](http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/feb/18/is-twitter-bad-for-economic-growth-bank-of-england)  that aren't being considered. 

Most of all I wonder if I'll ever get all the things in my head out and onto this blog.
