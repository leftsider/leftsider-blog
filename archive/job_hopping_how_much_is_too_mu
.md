<blockquote>Between the ages of 20 and 30, most people have more than 8 jobs. This is a positive thing for a number of reasons. First of all, Daniel Gilbert, psychologist at Harvard, says that we really don't know what we'll like until we try it. So having a lot of jobs when you start your adult life is a good way to figure out what to do with your adult life.</blockquote>

Thank you for saying hello! I'd rather my blog make you wow and resolve to do more--like Brazen Careerist, of course--but until I figure out how to do that...yeah, I work for cheap laughs. :)
