I may post some things today, but otherwise posting on leftsider will cease for a bit as the exodus begins. 

Time to actually start packing; we head to Seoul on friday. Then we'll be traveling in Japan four a few days, arriving in the States next thursday. Once we're there, however, I'll be making lots of trips to finalize our housing (and turn on the internet!), prepare for my job, and just send out a general "we're back!" So let's just say I should be back in the groove by mid-march.

Consider any posts before then an unexpected treat and a sign of my love and dedication to you. Or, proof of my internet addiction. heh. In the mean time, keep an eye on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/">my Flickr account</a> for the early jump on travelling pics.
