For the past couple of days I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda">Coda</a>, the new all-in-one web development solution from <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>. I have a lot of admiration for the Panic team, and the idea of a simple, multi-faceted application intrigued me.

I have to admit, I don't do much webdev anymore. There were times where all I would do was code, code, code. Nothing serious, this was a long time ago so it was largely HTML and basic Javascript. I still remember saving up my nickels to buy that first Macromedia suite. Then I tried freelancing and got burned enough that I lost interest in anything even related to webdev. My skills rusted, and Dreamweaver made it so easy to go WYSIWYG that I found myself only switching to code to make minor tweaks whenever I did work on a website.

Coda has singlehandedly reinvigorated my interest in coding. As I wrap my head around its features, I can see how this app would handle most everything that I would need to do at my level of skill. In fact, this past week I've removed my Adobe and Macromedia apps (which I don't use all that much these days anyway) and used this application in exclusivity.  Aside from finals and papers, this is the big reason I've not been updating for the last week or so--I've been coding, and man, am I out of shape. When I get back to form, you'll definitely see it in a less frankenstein version of Leftsider (along with a few other projects I've been brewing).
