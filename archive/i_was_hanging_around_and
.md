I was hanging around and doing my thing, talking to people and making connections. I bumped in to Joey along the course of my socializing, so naturally we decided to ride home together.

We talked about stuff, laughing and joking in our usual way; Joey talked about the stupidity of one thing or the other and I tried to bring out the bright side in a humorous manner. We got home and sat down and just continued in light conversation.

Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. "Joey," I asked after having a nice laugh over something, "Am I going crazy?"

He looked at me funny, but didn't say anything--almost as if he wasn't sure if I was serious or priming another punchline. "Cause if I'm not crazy," I said, "How are you here when you died last January?"

"That's because I...." He started, but then his eyes got that faraway look as if he really had to think about this one. "It's, well, it's.....I died....yeah....well I guess the reason is.....uh....yeah I died...."

"And if I'm not crazy," I continued, slowly starting to lose composure, "Why am I the only one that can see you?"

Joey just sat there, on the sofa, and I, sitting on the floor, bowed my head as a wave of emotions I couldn't contain started forward. But before I could let go, I realized that I was lying, face-down, in my bed. 6:30am, with the begininngs of tears in the corners of my eyes.

What a way to start a Monday. I'm sure this week's going to be fun. :(
