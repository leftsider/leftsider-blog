BODY:
I am an oddity in Korea on many levels. I'm a long-haired black man. I'm not from Africa, not in the military, and not an English teacher. Moreover, I came to Korea to study the language and culture and I'm having a really good time that has really enriched me. I promote Korea, especially Daegu, with a heartfelt fervor.

It's probably <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/11/pub_crawl.htm">already evident</a>, then, that I have <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/08/leftsider_the_hermit.htm">difficulties dealing with prolonged exposure</a> to foreigners here in Korea. This is especially true for those of us who come from the western hemisphere. Because I fall in that category, perhaps this is not the best thing to say. I hope you will recognize me as an exception to the rule; if not, let me know where <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/08/combating_stupidity.htm">I can change</a>.

The first and foremost issue that I have with foreigners is that often do not make an effort towards assimilation. So many people complain about things being "different," "weird," or "so 'Korean'," yet they fail to realize that they are the visiting strangers. If you are in Korea, expect things to be Korean. Why would they be like America? This is not America. I imagine these are the same people who, when in the US, would complain about people who don't speak English well.

The next thing could probably be considered 1.1: wallowing in misery. For every moaning foreigner, there are another four who have to listen to their story. Out of those four, one or two are quite possibly new to Korea and are receiving subconscious instruction to reciprocate this wheel of whining. This seems to be especially true of English teachers. Foreigners in Korea tend to disproportionately be in this category, so I don't know if my use of especially is really valid.

These two really are the meat of my rant, but there are a few other things that really irritate me. I can't for the life of me understand these horrible phenomena:

Foreign residents very rarely adopt the clothing styles of Korea. Instead, they adopt a "I bought this at Old Navy in 2001" look that becomes even more disheveled when brought into contact with Korean laundering. Why must we look so bummy? 

On that note, most foreign residents that I've met have been very slim or unhealthily overweight. I know that I lost about 15 pounds in my time here (much of which has been regained) so being slimmer is understandable. Being unhealthy, either slim or otherwise, is not. Well being is everywhere in korea. Western medicine, eastern medicine, health spas, skincare centers, yoga everywhere you look....it really would be in your greater interest to channel that disparaging energy you're pining away from towards something that will be beneficial to your life. Like learning to cook and making a little physical exertion here or there.

Ok the next one may not actually be your fault: you're often not very academic. I'm saying it nicely; I have a hard time seeing many foreign teachers holding a similar or applicable position in their home country. That is your fault, but the fact that all of you happened to gravitate here may be Korea's fault more than anything. As it stands, I feel I have lost most of my intellectual conversation skills due to compromising for learning Koreans and dim expats. Just this week some Koreans bashfully asked me why their teachers so often misspelled words--a rarity in Korea. I covered you by noting the Korean language's anchoring to meanings held in Hanja and such which don't exist in english words. But be sure, this employment-unfit student wonders the same thing sometimes.

Finally, culture. Ok so most of us are from the US and Canada, but are we really all the same? Foreign residents, in my humble opinion, leave no incentive to the Korean population to develop a heterogeneous society. All foreigners seem to do is dress bad, act sullen, and drink in designated venues (Some might also add "steal our women," but I haven't lost my wife to theft so I'm going to leave that one alone. Ha). No book clubs,  no forums, no community awareness initiatives or anything. Maybe I was spoiled coming from the DC metro area. A quick scan of our closest married friends confirms that, actually: White married to Korean, Panamanian married to White, Israeli-South African married to Jewish-South African, Filipino, Dominican, Japanese....ok I'm privileged but that doesn't mean we can't have any diversity here.

Perhaps this chastisement does come a bit unannounced; I apologize. But for the last two weekends I have been trapped in situations where I was  trapped with these glaring annoyances. I get frustrated when I'm pigeonholed with people of this ilk, and you know that Leftsider is my place to vent.  Rant off.

Hey Bryan

I'm in Daegu and I'm not one of those bar-clutching dimwits you're talking about. I'm sure there are quite a few people about who want more out of life than beers and moans, we just don't know how to get together.
I'm trying to start a writer's group which could also be a book group. Get in touch if you're interested. (I'm a little chubby right now so I'm little nervous about sending you this invitation - be gentle ok? ;->)

Hey Rachel

I'm quite sure that there are exceptions to my (very loose) rule so I'm more than willing to grant your difference. As far as getting together, I'd instead recommend spreading out as far as you can--and then being the bridges that connect the general population to the general foreigner mass.

I'm not much of a writer, and my reading choices these days are decidedly academic, but if you're looking to pull something together I may have a solution that would befit us both. I'll be in touch.

Hiya, 

This really is a very thoughtful post and as a gyopyo, echoed my sentiments exactly.  

When I first saw your photos, I thought exactly what you said: you are an anomoly (to put it politely) In South Korea so I marvelled at the way you and your wife seem to have carved out a true place for yourself in the society, accepting the good and the bad, in a way that mirrors my experience in Canada and Australia.  Similar complaints to those you mention from foreigners in Korea would be shot down so quickly in the West with ideas of how immediately "indebted" they are to their new country.

I am not religious and probably never will believe in a Christian God.  In my own state of bigotry,  tarred all Christians with the "you're so insular" brush.  It would seem that part of the reason you've been able to insinuate yourself so successfully is *because* of the network your church gives you.  Kudos. 

I've been humbled by your humility and grace. 

Oblivia

Undoubtedly, my church network has helped so much. I think that, also, my work with my denomination has given me a little more willingness to understand the other guy. And the opportunities for international travel really helped.

I'd like to think I could live anywhere; I don't know if I'm fooling myself with that notion or not.
