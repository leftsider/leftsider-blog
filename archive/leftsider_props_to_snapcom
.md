Just as an aside, I'd like to recognize <a title="Snap" href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap</a> and let them know how cool a team I think they are. 

If you aren't already aware, Snap.com provides a script that generates a small window preview of any outgoing links on your site. It's a novel little idea that gained popularity quickly. Just as fast, however, it gained a lot of (undeserved, IMHO) criticism from some of the web's finest, claiming that it was obtrusive, garish, and disrupted the flow of the web reading "experience."

The commendable thing about the team at Snap is that they didn't just listen to the needs of those people who loved and used them. They also listened to the nay-sayers and implemented features that allowed you to personally turn off Snap's preview boxes on a individual or total basis. Then they updated the script to give the administrator the ability to use the boxes as usual or to in an "upon-click" manner.  Listen to the flack, then shut them up. Excellent.

Now yesterday as I was putting up the first half of the vacation presentation, I noticed that the boxes were changing as I posted. Now, they support flickr photostreams and youtube videos more directly, along with a list of other sites that they make direct accommodation for. Constant improvement based on objective reception of feedback, good or bad, and logical progression always wins a big beat of pride in my heart. Keep up the good work Snap; success will be yours.
