So about the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">GTD</a> thing.

I initially wasn't interested in Getting Things Done simply because I'm never interested in things that <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/top_5_reasons_why_the_iphone_i.htm">everyone raves about and tells me I should do</a>. I'm pretty sure I know what my faults are as far as organization is concerned: I procrastinate and I'm lazy. I'm also an idealist, which never helps. Reading a book did not seem to me to be the logical solution to that conundrum. 

I did, however, want to know enough to reject the idea intellectually, so I borrowed the book from a friend (who had not finished it; typical) and started reading. The first chapters were unbelievably interesting, so I decided I'd follow the trend and do this GTD thing.

Note: I always feel like I'm cursing when I write GTD. ha. (In japanese emoticons, I'm actually sorta <a href="http://whatjapanthinks.com/2006/08/14/japans-top-thirty-emoticons/">banging my head on the floor</a>!)

I also  was able to get David Allen's Getting Things Done Fast presentation in Audio format with the workbooks. So I figured I'd listen to it and be done with it even faster. Well, if there's one thing that this system will do, it will take off those rose-colored glasses and tell you <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/9430051">the real deal</a>; I'm still nowhere near finished with the book or audiobook, and it shows.

Case in point: When I came to Leftsider today, I noted it was about time for a new photo. I thought that I might be able to put a link or two more, but after that, I'd like to put a picture before anything else significant--like this piece. I noted a typo and logged in to correct it, at which point a realized that there was <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/03/the_man_holding_me_down.htm">a comment that had not been attended to</a> (about GTD, coincidentally) . After addressing both issues, I got started on procuring the links for this post and decided to flesh out my ideas to ascertain which links I'd actually need. Upon writing, I realized (at this point, basically) that I was supposed to be putting an image before any prominent pieces. I went to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/friends/">Flickr</a>, to see what I could add. Unfortunately, there was an indication that someone had commented on my photos. I checked out what was new. A friend had left a half dozen messages--he had actually told me last week that he had, so I responded to them. On the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390387263/">last one</a>, I wanted to reference a Korean phrase I recently learned (when someone used it in reference to me in my <a href="http://cyworld.nate.com/leftsider">Cyworld Hompage</a>), but I couldn't remember it for certain. So, off to Cyworld I go to reference the spelling of this word. Upon login, I note that a few people had left comments in my guestbook. I, naturally, respond to them quickly; I recall that I've not talked to them on their pages for quite sometime, so I'm just about off to do that before I remember that there are still quite a few pics I haven't put in my Cyworld photo album. So instead I attach my phone to the computer and download the pics that have been waiting for release. It is while I'm sitting watching the files download that I remember: CRAP! I was getting a photo for Leftsider! Let me go do that now....wait...d'oh! I've a flickr page open waiting for a korean phrase I also forgot about....and on and on the cycle goes.

Can you see why I need GTD? ^-^;

If my own situation wasn't reason enough, Adam Greenfield got me all wrapped up in the idea of the working GTD system (<a href="http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2007/03/07/clean-living-approaching-the-optimal-stack/">what he calls the "optimal stack"</a>)...which is where I could spend the rest of my life work if given the opportunity. Kangmi's comments (on Leftsider; above) were the sobering reality that, despite all my efforts, I really wasn't getting anything done at all. Thankfully, someone who has <a href="http://www.kangmi.org/index/weblog/comments/tools_for_concentration_part_ii/">fared a little better</a> is extending some well-needed support.

All said, I'm committed now to GTD. If I can't finish the book, I may as well give up on ever hoping to accomplishing the actual details. I conned Fru into listening to the first CD, and now she is interested as well. I think it'd be nice to get it done together. I'm also encouraging my office team to do the GTD thing as well; that way they'll at least understand what I'm trying to do.

Got any other suggestions for making this silly thing work? Let a brother know.

Wow, I wrote that almost two years ago.

I can definitely say that my GTD practice today is very little like it was back in the beginning.

And while I'm happy to serve as a real live resource, you should check out some of the excellent GTD resources out on the Internet. There's a lot of good information (not all of which you need, by the way).

Your encouragement is support enough. ^^
There is a ton of info online, which I constantly run up against in my web searching. And don't think I didn't notice the frequency with which "Kangmi" and "GTD" showed up when googling for that post... you're pretty involved with the program!
