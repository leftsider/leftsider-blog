I started my yesterday at 6 am, getting to work early in order to leave before noon. I walked from work to a rental car office who was an hour late in providing me the car I reserved. I headed to Fru's job, grabbed some CDs from her car, and drove the two of us to Manhattan, through traffic, in about four hours. And then, about 2 hours later, I drove us back home. 

Why? In a word, friendship.

When we lived in Korea, Fru had a few students who took her out and about while I was gone for business. They gradually integrated into our social activities became good friends. One in particular was the group organizer, planning girl outings, taking the teachers' group for social outings, even recruiting students to join her in attending my religion class. An ambitious girl, she was offered a job in Seoul and moved away within days. We met with her on our last night in Korea and promised to stay in touch.

Her current company gives her occasional traveling opportunities, and this time she ended up at a trade convention in NYC. DC to New York is roughly the distance from Daegu to Seoul, so we decided to visit her this weekend. Unfortunately, plans changed, and she now was leaving Friday night, just before midnight. We adjusted our plans.

Car, tolls, parking, gas, meal; was it really worth it for 120 minutes with a friend? We say yes. <strong>The value of friendship should be greater than the requirements of maintenance.</strong> We'll most likely do this again when friends from Seattle and South Africa show up at our doorstep at some point this week (another change of plans; so we currently don't know when they'll arrive).

Unfortunately, an adherence to friendship of this intensity I've never seen in America. Every relationship of this level was either built in Korea or with people who have had the Korean experience. Those friends coming this week were fellow teachers in Korea (and not nearby, frequently associated friends), and the two other people who I can qualify with this kind of relationship are married to each other and were instrumental in our going to Asia.

I haven't decided yet whether the dominant factor in this friendship development is the high value of networks in Korean culture or the accommodating(commiserating?) bond that expatriates share. In either case, it's a factor that is nearly absent in American culture. It's hard enough getting my family to take a 90-mile trip to see me here, let alone friends in other regions of the country.

If there's any redeeming value to our lack of emphasis on maintaining personal relationships I'd love to hear about them.
