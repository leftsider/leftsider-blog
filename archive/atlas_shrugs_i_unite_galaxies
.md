BODY:
If you really want to be a magnetic personality, you have put out a little. <br /><br />Despite the existing duties of work (two jobs, now) and school, I've taken it upon myself to rouse my friends and associates out of their suburban stupor and get them active, socially and/or physically. To this end I established B.A.S.T.I.O.N., Bryan Against Suburban Tendencies of Inactivity, Obstinacy and Negativity. Our first event was in October (I think). It was a variant on the <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-09/st_pechakucha">Pecha Kucha</a> meme that we named 20twenty.<br /><br />Right now, the event of the moment is "<b>Galaxies Unite!</b>", an outing to see MLS teams DC United and LA Galaxy battle it out at RFK Staduim in Washington, D.C. Soccer enthusiasts and fans of <a href="http://www.davidbeckham.com/">David</a> (and <a href="http://www.people.com/people/victoria_beckham">Victoria</a>) Beckham have been assembled to go and watch and enjoy the day.<br /><br />Most people don't know is that planning an event is a complex and stressful process that isn't for the faint of heart. It takes a lot of risk and "testicular fortitude" to keep it from falling through; basically think of the entire event as resting on your shoulders. Here's a sneak peek into what is making this event work.<br />

EXTENDED BODY:
Milli was really the one who announced the game. After receiving her email, I asked if I could make it an event. Placing it on Facebook, it quickly generated a lot of interest. We quickly had nine definite attendees and ten maybes. <br /><br /><div class="thumbnail"><div align="center"><a href="http://skitch.com/leftsider/qwxd/facebook-events"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080627-nkruduknm1cnysni63y42ssrqd.preview.jpg" alt="Facebook | Events" /></a><br /></div><br />At this point, group ticketing was a viable option. Milli and I discussed, and we thought it would be worth it. The issue: for this event package deals started at twenty people. This means we needed to solidify those maybes into tangible bodies. I took up the challenge, deciding that the value of this event was worth the cost; I bought the tickets personally. <br /><br />When you've just made a purchase for $800 worth of tickets and you haven't collected a dime towards the cost yet, a bit of panic sets in. This is a good thing. You channel that energy into <br />the promotion of the event and the persuasion of possible attendees. Every day, you wake up thinking about ways to keep from eating the cost.<br /><br />Of the nine original confirmed attendees, at least four have backed out. Even so, right now I think I only have three tickets left, and I'm offering two of those today as a bridge to new relations with my neighbors (who we've not really engaged since moving in). With one unassigned ticket left, I consider this another considerable achievement and a sure sign of event success. The confidence of accomplishment that you get here is a euphoric antitype of the panic you had a week ago.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, living life. Stepping a few paces further out than you are prepared for and making back by a before-undiscovered will and resolve. It is the core generator of B.A.S.T.I.O.N., as well as the secret of successful business. Learn it now and use it in your future.<br /></div>
