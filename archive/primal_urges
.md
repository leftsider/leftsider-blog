As my <a title="Living Single (Leftsider)" href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/living_single.htm">"Living Single"</a> post has veered to a slightly different topic in the comments, I thought I'd reincarnate it with another topic I've been discussing recently. 

Apparently it's put Bryan on blast season, because this story again involves someone <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/09/double_placebo.htm">calling me out very audibly in public</a>. At lunch, an acquaintance asked me, "Why don't you wear a wedding band?" When I gave her my answer, she said. "I don't buy that. You need to get a ring."

At this point, the entire table erupted in a debate as to whether or not the wedding band was a must for fidelity. Advocates said that it indicated how to approach a person and what to expect from them. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5359395/site/newsweek">Naysayers</a> rebutted that it was a cultural traditional effect, and thereby had no true attachment to universal truth or, in this instance, faithfulness.

In all the clamor (I eat lunch with a rowdy bunch) I really wasn't asked my input, ironically. For what it's worth, I feel that every person should be able to approach a person in a way that is perfectly amicable but is in no way disrespectful of their marital status. If a ring determines your behaviour then I feel you have control issues. <strong>Your behaviour and interaction with others should be <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5359377/site/newsweek/">deliberately determined by YOU</a>.</strong>

This is particularly my opinion when I interact with singles who have a lack of regard for the wedding band and marital status. These people are not bad or wrong, nor are they demeaning or insulting; I pity these people in most cases for adhering to primal urges rather than higher reason. The reason <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/living_single.htm#comment-71">I feel weak in these situations</a> is because I have an innate sense of manipulation; I make an effort  to not take advantage of people that don't have the same level of information. In fact, my whole fascination with social networks may stem from the fact that it very often allows people to live in a society where information is available to all--making a more level playing field.

On the other side, of which I've only become aware through the recent commenting, I'm ashamed of married people who prey on naivete. However, I'm not sure how I feel about married-to-married, though. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/15432406.htm">Who's fooling who</a>?

In other cultures, where mistresses are tolerated, or polygamy practiced, or where marital bonds are shunned, do my philosophies still stand? Do yours? Is there a universal rule that can keep you safe in any environment?
