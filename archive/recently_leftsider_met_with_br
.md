<em>Recently Leftsider met with Bryan Collick, who has just returned to the US after living in Korea since late 2004. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:</em>

<strong>LS:</strong> Welcome back, Bryan. Are you finding your reception pleasant?

<strong>BC:</strong> Absolutely. Between our families and my co-workers...it's almost like I'm a football hero.

<strong>LS:</strong> Co-workers...Are you working already?

<strong>BC:</strong> Yep. Today is day three. Really nice having a schedule again. It's not the best job I could have gotten but it's decent and it pays the bills. I've got an apartment to pay for after all. And Fru isn't working yet...

<strong>LS:</strong> So you have an apartment already as well! Wow, how long have you been back? 

<strong>BC:</strong> Well...(looks at watch) tonight will make exactly one week. And before you ask, no I'm not suffering from jetlag. I have a routine I follow which usually leaves me 80% adjusted when I arrive in a new time zone. Coming back I had a lot of things to accomplish in a short period of time, so I had to ensure that I was up and running as soon as possible. 

<strong>LS:</strong> Yeah that was my next question. I guess a lot of people are asking the same things.

<strong>BC:</strong> Yeah. Ironically, I think Korea prepared us for coming back from Korea. In Korea everyone you first meet usually asks how long you've been there, if you like it, what's your favorite food, and if you miss home. When you get back everyone asks, "Wow! how long have you been gone?" "How was Korea?" "Do you like Korean food?" and, of course, "Are you glad to be back?"

<strong>LS: </strong>Never thought of it that way, but yes. So are you glad to be back?

<strong>BC:</strong> No, but with explanation.
