<blockquote>Soon we will gather in front of our televisions and watch receivers run over the middle and linebackers dive headfirst at loose footballs. We will tell ourselves we could do this too, if we were paid millions, or if we were famous, or if we took steroids. But we'll forget how the game of football is born out of hunger, and courage, and desperation, and community, and hope. And how sometimes it's played in spite of everything else.

The proof is tucked away, far from our malls and mansions, in the endless fields by Lake Okeechobee, where the land burns and the rabbits run.</blockquote>

This is the kind of story that makes me realize how much I have forgotten of my upbringing. While I did not live anywhere near here or do anything similar, it bears the distinct feeling of survival approaching art that I remember as a child. That I attached to everyday people who stood as heroes in my early mind and heard about in stories.

Occasionally I wonder if the efficiency and advancement that technology brings is worth the loss of these basic, even primal, characteristics. The heroes of my formative years have bent with age, and their successors have abandoned the form (myself included). Is it a time forever lost?

To what extent does the reduction of poverty and suffering stifle the human capacity to persist and expand. Can I still be hungry when my needs have been met?
