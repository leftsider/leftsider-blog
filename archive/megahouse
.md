<blockquote>The Megahouse system organizes the reservoir of empty rooms in a city and makes them available to users based on particular space and time needs—from hours to months. With Megahouse, the boundaries between private and public space are shifted as users walk between the many rooms of a “house” that are dispersed and embedded throughout the entire city.</blockquote>
