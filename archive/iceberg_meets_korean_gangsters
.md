<blockquote>From seemingly out of nowhere there appeared no less than six gangsters who lined up behind my friend. Oblivious to their presence, my friend tightened his grip around the bbi kki's collar and continued his interrogation. "Oh shit," I thought, "this is going to get ugly." I walked up to within a couple of feet of the gangsters, preparing to do what little I could to help out my friend should they decide to jump him. </blockquote>
