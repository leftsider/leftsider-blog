<blockquote>"Keep the 4,900 yuan if you really need it, but please return the other things to me. You are still young. To err is human. Correcting your mistakes is more important than anything," Pan wrote.

She gave up hope of seeing her possessions again after sending 21 text messages without a reply.

But on her way out on Sunday morning, she stumbled over a package that had been left in her courtyard only to discover it was her stolen bag. Nothing had been taken.</blockquote>

I can't help but wonder if this is more than just an "oddly enough" piece. Lately I've been berating the masses (nagging my friends) over the irresponsible nature of American suburban living. We tire of the cramped spaces, lack of privacy, noise, crime, pollution; so we move out to the suburban areas, build a big house, a car and enjoy the quiet, peaceful life.

Problem is, we become isolated. The only people we interact with are the ones we let into our lives; as a result we have very little protocol for dealing with people we don't know and do not meet. Additionally, we forget that no one likes to live in unpleasant environments--which almost guarantees that the negative aspects of urban living will be transmitted into these suburban havens. This is what happens when you change the location instead of fixing the problem.

So. Now you are in the suburbs with noisy neighbors, kids who knock over your mailbox or mill around on the streets near your house. You are a prisoner in your castle because you have no interaction with anyone outside of your circle; the only time you even see these people is as you walk to your car. You moved to a gated community. The cycle continues.

What about facing issues? It's harder to steal/vandalize/misuse something that belongs to someone you know. It's also hard to be afraid of someone who you have consistent personal interaction with, no matter what walk of life they are from. What if we stopped running from problems and started walking towards them? Everyone would be improved in the long run. Like the lady in this article, what if we stopped trying to get people thrown in prison and actually, tangibly, tried freeing them from debilitating situations? I'm not talking tossing money at the problem; I'm talking visibility. Personal association.

Hey, I'm just as guilty. But we can work on it together, can't we?
