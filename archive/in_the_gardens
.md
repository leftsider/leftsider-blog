	Stop three was to the Waterfall Gardens, where they have a bunch of cool stuff in addition to waterfalls. The butterfly garden was probably the highlight of the tour, although only edging out the hummingbird garden. There was also an orchid garden, which probably wouldn't have been so pathetic if I hadn't been to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/sets/1716333/">the world's largest orchid garden</a> a year or so earlier. The snake tour was lame, though. And there were some other things that didn't really register.<br />

The guy in the photo was in our tour group along with his mother and sister. They lived in Chiba prefecture, Japan. The mother studied Spanish in college and therefore was ok touring around. The kids were studying English, of course. So we had a good time with a few minutes of NihonSpanglish as the six of us communicated. :)

We ended off the tour with a river ride in Puerto Viejo de Sarapiqui. Spotting birds and sloths and monkeys in the trees; things of that sort. Finally it was time to drive back to San Jose and call it a night.
