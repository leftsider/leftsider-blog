This weekend we headed up to Seoul, with a few associates in tow, for a company-sponsored Christmas program. We weren't exactly sure what to expect, but we made the best of it, making additional plans for Sunday in case Saturday night's event was a bust.

Almost every time we go to Seoul we meet up with Leo and Laura. Both work in the office which oversees expatriate employees and would technically be considered Frulwinn's superiors. Yet since our initial orientation week when we first arrived, we have basically interacted completely as friends; in fact my flickr has quite a few pictures of them spending weekends here with us. 

This week was of no exception. We met up with them after the long corporate function and watched movies at Leo's house. I had suggested watching "The House of Flying Daggers," but my selection was pre-empted by the popular consensus, "White Chicks." 

*sigh*

After the two movies ( I needed some type of redemption after that first movie so I pushed to watch a second) it was just past 3am. We dragged ourselves through the harsh Seoul wind to our guest house where we promptly passed out.

But this entry isn't a recap of our weekend. Actually I just wanted to give a good word. On the way up I received a call from Leo checking to see if we were coming and where we were. Then after the party we went to his house for fun and entertainment. The next morning, as I played ping pong with Miez and Rogan, he called again--and was there to play 20 minutes later.

Leo had business in Kwanju, but he adapted his schedule to accomodate us all the way to the subway where we parted ways (he to Yongsan station and us to Seoul sation). And once he was on his train, he called again to see if we were finding ourselves ok in Seoul still. That's a nice guy.

Every couple years or so, I run into a guy like this, and I often fail to truly appreciate their genuine friendship. No one ever calls me unless they want something--be it information, assistance, or just an ear to listen. So I'm always taken aback when someone takes interest for no apparent reason than that <em>they like me</em>. To me, it really is an interesting phenomenon.

So here's three cheers to Leo and friends without intentions. I think we all could use a few more of those in our lives.
