People in US ask me regularly if I'm excited to be returning. Koreans wonder why foreigners are so eager to go home. I look at this story, and I truly don't know. Moreover, I'm not used to that anymore; I've lived in peace for the last year.

I'm so no ready to return to the US if this is what I'll get.
