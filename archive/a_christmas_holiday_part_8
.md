	Even though the cousins had enough plans to last us another week, we decided to head back north on the 2nd. We took the super-scenic Pacific Coastal Highway north until the sun set.<br />
<br />
That's about it for major parts of the trip. We ate lunch with Max and Emily of Ideacodes on Thursday, but I forgot to take a picture. Rains came that afternoon, so we stayed indoors until the flight home. <br />
<br />
Cali has a great feel about it, one that is more than just pleasant weather and progressiveness. I can't put my finger on it, so I guess I'll have to visit again!
