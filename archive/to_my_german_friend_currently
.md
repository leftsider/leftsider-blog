To my German friend, currently living outside of Hambug:
<blockquote>
leftsider: Eike I really like you buddy, but we're on opposite sides of the line today
leftsider: My mother is from Costa Rica ;)
Eike: oh boy
Eike: well our captain is sick so you guys have good chances :)
leftsider: well honestly, I think we'll need it.
leftsider: But if we can get past you guys it should be smooth sailing.
Eike: ....IF....
leftsider: :D</blockquote>

Why are you still here??? The game is about to start!!!!
Cheer for Costa Rica!
