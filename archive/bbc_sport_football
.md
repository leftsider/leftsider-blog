Well since they are one of the two teams without Korean members that get airtime here, I've been watching this team a bit and I'm totally not surprised. Sucks to be Luxemburgo though. Scapegoat is a hard role to play.

The way I feel about it? It's the has-been team. Everyone loves the name--and names that make the roster: Beckham, Ronaldo, Carlos.  I personally like <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4250368.stm">Robinho</a> and hold him as an exception, but otherwise its a team full of aging stars. No coach can do anything about that.
