<blockquote>They spoke of a black America adrift. Black males are more common in prisons than on college campuses, they said. Black children, meanwhile, are increasingly born into single-parent homes.

"A lot of us have lost the dignity that our community has shown from Jamestown to now," Sharpton said.

Others pointed to a lack of personal responsibility among blacks who, they said, are waiting for leaders to make changes.
