<blockquote>I'll gift this Shibuya blinged iPod Nano to the first person who can guess my job come January 1st 2007. Bonus points for naming the city and country I'll be living in and, gosh, the name of my employer.

Post your answers to the comments.

The glittering prize will be shipped to one lucky winner once I figure out the answer myself.</blockquote>

Nice way to find out who your readers are....and possibly an innovative way to obtain a list of potential employers? I've guessed twice, despite the fact that the nano is rather garish.
