BODY:
A couple weeks ago I went to the bookstore with a friend and ended up buying a book that looks pretty interesting. <a title="Let's Learn Korean - Learn Hanja the Fun Way" href="http://letslearnkorean.com/index.php/korean/comments/learn-hanja-the-fun-way/">Learn Hanja the Fun Way</a> takes an interesting approach to learning the Hanja (Chinese characters) upon which 70% of korean vocabulary is based. Probably not the best place to start your korean study, but definitely good if you're looking for stronger grasp on vocab and/or branching to japanese or chinese later.

I personally was sold on it because it was written by someone born and raised attended 경북대 right here in Daegu, but it seems that it has gotten favorable reviews.

The entry you linked to on my site has for some reason gone to my ESL blog (re: domain) a better link which gets the same entry and the correct domain is http://letslearnkorean.com/index.php/korean/comments/learn-hanja-the-fun-way/
