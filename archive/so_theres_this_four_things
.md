BODY:
So there's this "Four Things" meme going around and it's really pissing me off.

"Why?" you may ask. Well, for various reasons. The first and initial reason is that I dislike having to read through all that mess, and then after you're done you have to clear the last person's answers and fill the dumb thing out. This was old back when I used to get them every week (weak!) when I was using Hotmail. It's mad old now.

But then, <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/01/30/four_things">all</a> the <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2006/01/four_things.html">cool kids</a> are <a href="http://www.megnut.com/2006/01/my-four-things">doing it</a> in <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/01/four-things">spades</a>. Big names; hotshots. So I desperately want to do it to associate with greatness. But to truly use the meme correctly it must be passed to you.....and who's going to pass to me? <a href="http://rabiddustbunnies.blogspot.com/">Ed</a>? Yeah, ok.

Once I realize the futility of ever being a part of this wildly popular meme that I will grumble about doing, I realize that I'd be a dead end anyway. Who to pass to? <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">Fru</a>? <a href="http://kymjoi.blogspot.com/">Kim</a>? it's depressing. 

So there. That's why I'm peeved. I'm going to mope now.

trust me, in the blogging world we're not much more than that. How can we change that?
