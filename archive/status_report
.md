<p>For the few of you that are still subscribed, or occasionally check in, yet do not already know, I've picked up a second job. It'll be my primary job, and my freelance consulting (which I've still never formally announced) will be accepting new work on a very limited basis.</p>
<p>Back in September, when I <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/08/why-im-leaving-my-job.htm">left my job</a>, I hoped that someday I could come back and work in a capacity where my passions were more accurately applied and when there was more incentive to change things for the better. Today, as an Assistant Director of Communication for the Seventh-Day&nbsp;Adventist Church, I've got more opportunity to do what I hoped than I ever <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/830370080">imagined possible</a>.</p>
<p>This is a good thing. It means more action here on Leftsider, less clandestine activity, and a whole new realm of projects which I hope to showcase as they grow. In my mind, I totally envision this turning out not unlike <a href="http://www.andrewmager.com/">Mager's blog</a>, but man I've got a long way to go for that; I'll settle for something slightly more animated than what <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/">Jan's blog</a> has become. ;)</p>
<p>I guess that means I'll be involving you as well. Look to see comments return in the near future. It'll be great to see what you think of the new chapter we've begun.</p>
