	In addition to the bars on everyone's house, it would seem that there's a bar at practically every intersection in a Costa Rican city. Pictured are two of Ramiro's friends. He is a mathematician, she is a professor in horticulture, I believe.<br />
<br />
As I do not drink, Ramiro spurned me in favor of Tav, who as aforementioned is down for anything. :)
