If you're looking for an exercise in brilliant stupidity, I've decided to only send <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> messages that contain exactly 7 words from now until American Thanksgiving, November 23. You can see my palabric prowess (you like how I just turned a spanish noun into an english adjective, don'tcha?) on my main page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(theatre)#Stage_directions">stage left</a>. Why not join up and try it with me? I'll add you, no questions asked.

PS - Twitter now works with IM too, if you're not into the mobile text messaging thing.
