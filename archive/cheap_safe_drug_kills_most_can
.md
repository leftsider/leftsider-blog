<blockquote>DCA can cause pain, numbness and gait disturbances in some patients, but this may be a price worth paying if it turns out to be effective against all cancers. The next step is to run clinical trials of DCA in people with cancer. These may have to be funded by charities, universities and governments: pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to pay because they canâ€™t make money on unpatented medicines. The pay-off is that if DCA does work, it will be easy to manufacture and dirt cheap.</blockquote>

There are a lot of things I find interesting about this. It's possible that you would have to use this drug for an extended period of time--perhaps indefinitely. Would a lifetime of pain be worth delaying death? Also very sad to be reminded of how little pharmaceutical companies are interested in helping heal. But I shouldn't be surprised, right? <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/how_to_kill_a_personality.htm">A company is a company</a>, remember that.
