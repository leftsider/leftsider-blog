For the last couple months I've been working under the radar with a team of people who are working on a new version of <a href="http://emilychang.com/go/ehub">eHub</a>, the <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/07/stop_calling_it_the_web.htm">internet2.0</a> app compendium founded by <a href="http://ideacodes.com">Emily Chang</a>. I submitted interest in participating on a lark, and I was very pleasantly surprised when Emily contacted me directly after I didn't pursue my inquiry. She's pulled a great team together and everyone's really excited about what eHub is and where it will go.

It was kind of hard to not mention it, but there were confidentiality issues initially, and, to be honest, I wanted to feel out the situation and settle on it before announcing. I did let my position drop when submitting my bio for <a href="http://gien.adventist.org">GIEN</a> as I didn't feel my credibility would have been as visible without it.

The most exciting part about the whole ordeal is that my writing was chosen as the first among the new editors to publish. It nearly broke my heart when it was posted to the front page with a faulty link that prevented people from reading its entirety, but <a href="http://www.emilychang.com/go/ehub/app/check-your-receipt-ehub-reviews-personal-finance-sites/">it is available now</a>. I enjoyed doing the piece and could easily see myself doing that for a portion of my living. :)

That's all, just wanted to put it all out there. If you have a category or specific app you think needs attention/review, let me know and I'll see if I can write about it.
