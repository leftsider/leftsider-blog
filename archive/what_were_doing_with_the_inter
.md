Ouch. This one hits close to home. My green and blue abomination of a site design can only be self-made, but the cameraphone pics to flickr and the twitter feeds (look to your left, if you're not RSSing) are pretty spot on.

For what it's worth, my sluggishness in posting is not because of a departure from real content, but an indication that leftsider is again changing. I've been working in a few areas that don't directly apply to Leftsider's theme; I thought of creating new blogs to talk about them, but instead I think that I'll be changing from the MovableType blogging platform to a full-on content management system, where I can post about everything and then divide it up via tag-enabled categories. I'm testing that now, which is why I haven't been as visible with new posts.

Let's bring internet 2001 back, shall we?
