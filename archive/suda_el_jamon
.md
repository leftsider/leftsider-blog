"Jamon" is literally "ham," which adds a particularly interesting mental picture. 
I was thinking about this the other day in regards to my bit of pudge. I realize that 3-4 years ago I was doing a lot more dancing, running and other physical activity than I am now. Living in Korea--<a href="http://www.obesityresearch.org/cgi/content/full/12/12/1959">the land of thin</a>--helped me out while I was there, but now that I'm back and surrounded by "healthy" portions, processed food, and sugar levels that would just caramelize the Korean peninsula and <a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_4848001156">Asia in general</a>, I feel a need to get active again.

I won't go into <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/02/raising_the_bar.htm">previous discussions</a> about how I wrestle with that. I just wanted to share this video because the spanish title has potential to become a bit of a private encouragement between Fru and I; almost like a "give it your best."

How inspiring can this video be, however, when you know that getting healthy and exerting yourself physically is potentially lucrative to Nike? That they can spend a large sum of money making a video like this based on the return they expect--not based on their concern for your well-being. Is it really a commendable video when it is just showing your competitor (plastic surgery, medical body alteration) in a harsh light?
