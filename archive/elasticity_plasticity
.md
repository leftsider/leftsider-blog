Do you know the difference between elasticity and plasticity? 

Elasticity is the tendency of material to temporarily deform when placed under stress. It spreads, it stretches; it alters to accommodate the strain.

Plasticity is the tendency of a material to retain deformation it has received. Think clay, putty; it retains the shape or can be re-shaped into something entirely new. The point at which a material's elasticity turns into plasticity is considered that object's yield.

Both could be useful traits in life. One, however, is not progressive. <strong> How far you go is limited--and often less valuable--if your intention is to return back to your original state.</strong> Moreover, would you rather the plasticity in your life be deliberate (think adapting like putty) or a consequential <em>yield</em>?

Things I'm thinking about (though perhaps not in the way intended), thanks to that wise sage <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2007/05/alignment_ident.html">Jan</a>.
