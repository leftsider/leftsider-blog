BODY:
I understand the principle of a <a title="TrackBack - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">TrackBack</a>, but they have little to no relevance to me on my site. In fact, they've become more than a slight nusiance.

On monday I deleted 89 trackbacks from Leftsider. Today, wednesday, I deleted 50. These trackbacks had descriptions and links that made my stomach turn. I mean really; I had to stop eating after clearing that crap out.

What good is a trackback? Especially if you're not frequently read, it's just an opportunity for misuse. Someone please tell me why I should let this madness continue.
