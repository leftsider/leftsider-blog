	Perhaps you know by now that I was all about pleasing the Mrs. on this trip. We had a really nice hotel, but when they got sketchy on the internet provisions I seized the moment and decided to check if anything else good was available. As a result, we got to spend the night in a five-star hotel.<br />
<br />
The Mandarin Oriental KL is no joke. It was Fru's first time staying in a 5-star (it was mine, as well, but you know I have appearances to upkeep so I was decidedly ho-hum about the whole thing) and they really impressed her. This kinda worried me because even she noted that our trip was just getting better and better....could I keep up the pace?<br />
<br />
BTW, the building right outside my window? That's the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/78746066/">Petronas Towers</a>.
