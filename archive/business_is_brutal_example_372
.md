<blockquote>You might remember a post I wrote back in August about selling xPad. It didn't turn out as planned, and I want to talk about it here for a moment because I think it's important for everyone to know what happened.</blockquote>

It takes a lot of work to make something successful. And when you want to set it free you have a lot of anticipation. The problem is that the ones who oversee it after you step back rarely have the same care and concern as you. Quite often, they're also more interested in gain than progress. This is why things like this happen to all of us. I sincerely wish it wouldn't.
