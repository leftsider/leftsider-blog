	So yeah it was a typical week; work and family and oh yeah I drove 2700 miles across the country with my German pal, Enno. Guess it wasn't a typical week after all.<br />
<br />
We left Friday afternoon, heading to Berrien Springs, Michigan, where his brother was hosting his parents and visiting grandparents from Holland. We spent Saturday with them, and took off early Sunday morning, driving through Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, reaching Colorado just as a snowstorm decided to do its business.<br />
<br />
After a nice night in Denver, we drove over those gorgeous colorado mountains, across the state, through Utah and Nevada (with a mandatory stop in Sin City), reaching California just after midnight.<br />
<br />
Tuesday was mostly spent recovering from our three-day blitz. We also met up with <a href="http://staires.org/"> Brad</a> and <a href="http://veritas.staires.org/">Mike</a> (@brad and @obsy on <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a>) for a good bit of humorous conversation before I was whisked off to the airport for a red-eye flight to Boston and a connecting flight home.<br />
<br />
People say I was crazy to make such a trip, but I think that may have been the best thing to happen in 2008 so far. I sometimes have to remind myself that the level of excitement in my life is totally dependent upon me. And the experiences I gained really add up (more on that later).
