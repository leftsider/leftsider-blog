Ok let's get this one out of the way to move on to other news. You've heard enough about it already so I'll just point to Kottke's roundup, which misssed <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/topic/27395/#comment175780">my absolute favorite comment</a> about the whole thing.
<a title="Defense Tech: REPLACEMENT ARM, GOOD AS NEW" href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/001478.html">REPLACEMENT ARM, GOOD AS NEW</a>
If I can get a spycam, an automated swiss army knife, and a cellphone built-in, I'm game.
<a href="http://agorabbs4.media.daum.net/griffin/do/kin/read?bbsId=K150&articleId=6383&pageIndex=5&searchKey=&searchValue=">Uhhhh, I don't know what to name this one.</a>
Frighteningly fascinating. Can I try?
<a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_9456.html">EC-02, The little electric motorcycle by Yamaha</a>
I sooo need one of these right now. Sooo.
<a href="http://agorabbs4.media.daum.net/griffin/do/kin/read?bbsId=K150&articleId=6426&pageIndex=1&searchKey=&searchValue=">I turned the house upside-down the other day...</a>
Still didn't find what I was looking for. =o]
<a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200504/200504190029.html">Korean Women Take 17 Minutes to Put on their Face</a>
Korean men take the whole evening after work for getting ****-faced (sorry, I just mentioned the site to my grandma 5 minutes ago).
<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/lifestyle/220349_cellfakes.html">Dial F for fake cellphone calling.</a>
Yeah I've done it. I think it all started after I realized that every girl on campus I'd pass leaving my evening class was on the phone to avoid contact with strangers. So I did it to make them worry less that I was interested in them. It has it's purposes.
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7271">"Minority Report" interface created for US military</a>
A way to shift through large amounts of information quickly? Sounds like my perfect internet app. =o]

OK Fru is upset that I'm typing in bed...I guess the screen's light is keeping her up. So until next time.
