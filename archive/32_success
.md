BODY:
Finally got around to updating MoveableType. I mentioned it long before, but I dread the upgrades.

As it turns out, I had some dead ends on this installation as well, but most of them ironed out pretty smoothly. A big word of THANKS goes to whoever was involved in the vast overhaul the manual and knowledgebase was given; that thing is vastly easier to use.
