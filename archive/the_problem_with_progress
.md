It would be very easy for me to live my life in a bubble. I work 8-10 hours a day at a job 1 mile from my home. In the evenings I do classes; on the weekends I travel or fulfill other obligations. I could go for a very long time without seeing something new. So, to combat sterilization, I walk and take public transportation a lot. I cannot choose who will be on the bus. It's a random sampling of society, everyday.

There are two things I see on the bus everyday. 

<ul><li><strong>People like me.</strong> People who have my style, my concerns. People who are worried about their friends and family, about personal and social issues. I see people who are struggling to be as much as they can be--for their families, for themsleves. I honor and respect them, and draw my strength from them.</li>
<li><strong>People like me.</strong> People who don't seem to be going very far. People who see like me, but are biased by ignorance. People who could do so much more if they only pushed a little further. People trapping themselves in situations. Who just need to stop complaining and do something--for their community, for their families, for themselves. I have disdain for them, and they sap life from my bones.</li></ul>

I see myself in both sets (which often overlap), and it causes a dissonance within. One that makes me want to do my best and give up hope at the same time. One that reach out and yet pull away. I'm not quite sure how to deal. I end up with a lot of things on my mind and no real way to identify or explain them. I'm not really sure what to do about it either.
