The Sistine Chapel, Leonardo's sketches, Hokusai's wave--all use the same tool: the stroke. <br /></p>

<p>This is important for many reasons, but I feel the greatest is this: if knowledge of the tool expands the ability in a craft <a href="http://www.designsojourn.com/truths-about-creativity/">there is nothing inborn about creativity</a>. It is merely seeing something to its logical end which allows for what we consider to be the greatest works.</p><br />

EXTENDED BODY:
<p>In an interview on Charlie Rose, Malcolm Gladwell asserted that it
is perseverance and stubborn diligence which creates a master. If I
remember correctly he said that it's usually at the 10-year mark that
those we deem great will look back and say, "here's where it started to
feel natural; here's where I found myself completely comfortable within
my craft." </p>

<p>So it would seem that, yes, <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/10/how-creativity-is-killing-the.html">we are not all creative</a>... but simply because
we haven't put in the time. <br /></p><p>Additionally, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">school programs deem the arts and such
mind-expanding activities as less than necessary</a>, and we accept it. The
societal consensus tells us that it takes a dream and a lucky break to
be successful creatives, and (why? for the life of me <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/possible-titles-for-bravos-new-reality-shows,33604/">I don't know</a>) we believe it. I wonder what would happen
if we revised the default value and process for being creative. What
would we see in a century, even a generation.</p>

<p>I imagine we'd first see that being creative is not about using
colors or notes; it's about creating things. "Creating things" should
imply that what is created <i>was not</i>; "reinvention" is a horrible word that
confuses what really is happening. </p>

<p>What most often happens in our world is <b><i>design</i></b>, and design always
answers a question. Often times that question is very specific, but in
reality it usually always comes down to "what will make this better?" <br /></p><p>An artist creates, and as the creator is given the ultimate authority
as to what his creation means, what it is saying. A designer will
forever be bound to the definition of efficiency and improvement, and
should never be in a position to define their own work. They may state
what it does, but in truth that should be evident in the work itself
and by those who utilize it.</p><p>Which brings us full circle: it is the arrangement of strokes--its design, if you will--that makes us immediately tell a masterpiece from an amateurish rendering. And that design is the product of dedicated persistence; not whim. How many strokes came from Van Gogh's brush before "Starry Night"? Which stroke did not hone his ability to the level of that now-famous work?</p><p>How many strokes are between you and your goal?<br /></p><p><br /></p>
