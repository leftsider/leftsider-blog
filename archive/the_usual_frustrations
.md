BODY:
I know I can be better at things than I am currently. I know that I'm not being true to myself. Yet it's difficult to do otherwise, conditioned to look for acceptance in the eyes of others.

I know each brick must be formed in order to build a wall. I know that real things require persistence. Step by step; eating the elephant one forkful at a time. This in a world of impatience and impermanence, interruptibility and disposability. I want it all now and it shouldn't be difficult. 

In light of these things, I need to be patient with myself. Accept who I am and bring what I can more fully into each moment. In time, I'll look back and recognize change.
