This is why I love them. Type "weather Syracuse, NY" and you'll get a weather report for the week along with the most relavent search results. Fantastic.

Add this to <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>, <a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a>, <a href="http://www.froogle.com">Froogle</a>, <a href="http://suggest.google.com">Google Suggest</a>, <a href="http://gmail.google.com">Gmail</a>, and the labs in general--and maybe you'll love them too.
