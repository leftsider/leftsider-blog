BODY:
So I'm back in Daegu. That's South Korea, not some coincidentally-named place in Thailand. I ended up having a pretty lame time in Seoul, and, as a result, not going after all. Details after the hump.

EXTENDED BODY:
When a client asks you to come out and meet with them, you always say yes. It's really important to get a feel for their likes and dislikes, their wants and their idiosyncracies. Far too many freelancers learned this the hard way, present company included.

When a client asks you to come out and meet with them, you have two options: They bring you in, or you come in and they reimburse you. If they don't like your price, they may chose to make their own travel plans for you--which is fine since you don't have to worry about paying off the ticket you just put on a card somewhere.

Thing is, you really need to nail down both of these things. I, foolishly, didn't. So I went to Seoul for other business and stayed around to catch a flight. I called the client to let them know my ticket price and they balked. They offered to find me a better package, which I allowed. The package was a little sneaky, but I've probably arranged close to a half-million in travel plans so I was wise to the deal and willing to follow through.

Shortly after I got the package, I got a cancellation of the package. It came with a request to find my own ticket using the same travel agent hodge-podgery. Unfortunately, the time, day, and season were not favorable for their hopes. The cheapest ticket I could find was the one that I had originally planned to buy--and time was quickly running out. They suggested I wait a few days to get another flight. I suggested I go home to my wife and other business and they contact me when a travel plan is more certain.

All in all, no biggie. I'll probably still work with the client--although a little more formally. And, if the fates have it, I may still go to Thailand. But for now, I'm just glad to be home and relaxing with highspeed wireless internet.
