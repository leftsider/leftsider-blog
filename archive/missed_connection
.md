When we were on the subway in Busan, we were followed by a group of schoolgirls, who were kinda cute in a funny way.

They went past their stop just to figure out how to ask me for my email (written on paper in English). Now I've got a comment on the last post, but I'm not sure which girl it is....comment again and let me know!</p>
