<blockquote>Still, nobody has yet come up with a wholly persuasive explanation for what has caused the new inequality. Education is still a big part of the overall picture. Beyond education, it’s possible that social mores have changed to make huge salaries for chief executives and other top earners more acceptable. It’s also possible that the new inequality is a natural outgrowth of what Robert Frank, a Cornell professor, has called the “winner-take-all society,” in which globalization and technology have raised the relative value of the very highest paid jobs. Or it’s possible that the rightward drift of government policy over the last generation — deregulation and falling tax rates, for example — has somehow enabled the rich to gain at everyone else’s expense.</blockquote>
