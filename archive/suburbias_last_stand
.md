<blockquote>Cities, I feel, offer one of the most vivid and directly relatable examples of why diversity, mixing, randomness and human interaction are generally all good things, not variables to minimize. Places that rely on only one or two industries or that foster very little in the way of cross-cultural interaction limit themselves creatively and often bore themselves in the process. It may be tidy, efficient and cheap - like a shopping at a Wal-Mart - but it's hardly an enriching experience. </blockquote>
