For those of you watching Apple's switch to Intel, here's an interesting comparison chart for you.

I'm still up in the air about the whole thing. I'm itching to get back to the US and get reacquainted with XP,  but if I can buy a new Apple that runs both......why? I don't hate Apple, and actually I've become rather used to it, using for the last 14 months. 

Perhaps this is what Apple had in mind when they planned this whole thing. They're not out to make people hate PC (though there are legions of fanboys who do)-- they just figure if you had a totally open choice to do both, would you really still choose as you do now?

I think it's a smart mentality; I'm nearly sold. ;)
