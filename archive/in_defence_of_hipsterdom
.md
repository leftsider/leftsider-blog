<blockquote>
And I think this is why hipsterdom is often the pupal stage for artists or people who are interested in art. Hipster clothing and conversations are very standardized, but that's why they are useful: it enables young artists to find each other, and to talk about art in a way that emphasizes community rather than the deeply personal effect it has on most people. This is why hipsters are often obsessed with lists and categories rather than feelings. It's hard to describe why anyone would like Marcel Dzama and burlesque and knitting and neon purple tights and The Decemberists and Russian prison tattooes and R. Kelly, but if two participants in a conversation do like these lists of things, then they can recognize they have similar feelings about the world, however poorly they've expressed that viewpoint directly. Hipsterdom is a shorthand for a varied and shifting view of North American culture.</blockquote>
