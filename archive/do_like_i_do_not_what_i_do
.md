While I've always secretly looked for admiration from my peers, I've never wanted to be a role model. I think that, in general, looking up to me is looking sideways at best. At worst, you could be swimming towards the bottom of the pool.

Yesterday we hung out with 지훈 and 민정 downtown and had a really nice time. Near the end of our time hanging out, however, we started talking a lot about relationshipss and marital woes. And when I say "talked" I mean they talked; we listened.

I've noticed a few other times where they talked to us candidly about issues they face. They've even told us of things that we do that they've modeled in their own relationship. In short, I'm flattered; but in the long run I'm concerned.

Frulwinn and I have a good relationship. Not great, though pretty fantastic. We make our own rules and make a point not to follow suit for simplicity's sake. We do what we do because it works for us; so someone else finding our relationship appealing is refreshing only when you understand our philosophy.

I have enough problems of my own without worrying if my solutions fare well for the good of the common people. I am the head of a two-person party, not the CEO of married life. It all adds a little stress to my life since I do care for others.

I guess I should be grateful for an audience for my philosophies, but I just wanna do people right, you know?
