<blockquote>CAPTCHAs are the boxes of distorted text that you are asked to identify when you enter data or register with some websites. There's an example on the left. The idea is that they prevent automated sign-ups and spamming because it is relatively easy for humans to identify the distorted letters, but beyond the capabilities of most software.

Rogue advertising is big business on the net, and CAPTCHAs have become a significant barrier for people who rely on spam to make a quick buck selling dodgy Viagra, penis enlargement pills or grey-market imports. One way of getting round such security measures would be to enlist large numbers of people who type in the solutions. This is where the naked naked celebrities come in.

According to news reports, porn sites have been set up which require the user to solve a CAPTCHA to view the content. The CAPTCHAs, of course, are taken from other websites, and every user who provides the correct answer in their bid to see naked flesh also opens a door for spammers to automatically register another account or post another advert.</blockquote>

Just one example of how easy it can be to use the general population  as a means for questionable ends.
